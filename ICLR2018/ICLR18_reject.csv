In each layer of an SNN, the compression and the relevance are defined to quantify the amount of information that the layer contains about the input space and the target space, respectively. We jointly optimize the compression and the relevance of all parameters in an SNN to better exploit the neural network's representation. Previously, the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework (\cite{Tishby99}) extracts relevant information for a target variable. Here, we propose Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) for a neural network by utilizing (only) its model parameters explicitly to approximate the compression and the relevance. We show that, as compared to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) principle, PIBs : (i) improve the generalization of neural networks in classification tasks, (ii) push the representation of neural networks closer to the optimal information-theoretical representation in a faster manner.

1,S1pWFzbAW,Weightless: Lossy Weight Encoding For Deep Neural Network Compression,"The large memory requirements of deep neural networks strain the capabilities of many devices, limiting their deployment and adoption. Model compression methods effectively reduce the memory requirements of these models, usually through applying transformations such as weight pruning or quantization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for lossy weight encoding which complements conventional compression techniques. The encoding is based on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed technique, Weightless, can compress DNN weights by up to 496x; with the same model accuracy, this results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.","['Deep Neural Network', 'Compression', 'Sparsity']"

Each time a model is trained, one gets a different result due to random factors in the training process, which include random parameter initialization and random data shuffling. Reporting the best single model performance does not appropriately address this stochasticity. We propose a normalized expected best-out-of-n performance (Boo_n) as a way to correct these problems.","['evaluation', 'methodology']"
3,BywyFQlAW,Minimax Curriculum Learning: Machine Teaching with Desirable Difficulties and Scheduled Diversity,"We introduce and study minimax curriculum learning (MCL), a new method for adaptively selecting a sequence of training subsets for a succession of stages in machine learning. The subsets are encouraged to be small and diverse early on, and then larger, harder, and allowably more homogeneous in later stages. At each stage, model weights and training sets are chosen by solving a joint continuous-discrete minimax optimization, whose objective is composed of a continuous loss (reflecting training set hardness) and a discrete submodular promoter of diversity for the chosen subset. MCL repeatedly solves a sequence of such optimizations with a schedule of increasing training set size and decreasing pressure on diversity encouragement. We reduce MCL to the minimization of a surrogate function handled by submodular maximization and continuous gradient methods. We show that MCL achieves better performance and, with a clustering trick, uses fewer labeled samples for both shallow and deep models while achieving the same performance. Our method involves repeatedly solving constrained submodular maximization of an only slowly varying function on the same ground set. Therefore, we develop a heuristic method that utilizes the previous submodular maximization solution as a warm start for the current submodular maximization process to reduce computation while still yielding a guarantee.","['machine teaching', 'deep learning', 'minimax', 'curriculum learning', 'submodular', 'diversity']"
4,rJiaRbk0-,Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training ,"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent structures in sequence modeling. Its goal is to use gates to control the information flow (e.g., whether to skip some information/transformation or not) in the recurrent computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal and is easy to overfit. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing so, we can (1) better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state; and (2) avoid overfitting to certain extent: the gates operate at their flat regions, which is shown to correspond to better generalization ability. However, learning towards discrete values of the gates is generally difficult. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the recently developed Gumbel-Softmax trick from the field of variational methods, and make the model trainable with standard backpropagation. Experimental results on language modeling and machine translation show that (1) the values of the gates generated by our method are more reasonable and intuitively interpretable, and (2) our proposed method generalizes better and achieves better accuracy on test sets in all tasks. Moreover, the learnt models are not sensitive to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation of the gate parameters due to the flat loss surface.","['recurrent neural network', 'LSTM', 'long-short term memory network', 'machine translation', 'generalization']"
5,B14TlG-RW,QANet: Combining Local Convolution with Global Self-Attention for Reading Comprehension," Current end-to-end machine reading and question answering (Q\&A) models are primarily based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention. Despite their success, these models are often slow for both training and inference due to the sequential nature of RNNs. We propose a new Q\&A architecture called QANet, which does not require recurrent networks:  Its encoder consists exclusively of convolution and self-attention, where convolution models local interactions and self-attention models global interactions. On the SQuAD dataset, our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in inference, while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine translation model. 
On the SQuAD dataset, our single model, trained with augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the test set, which is significantly better than the best published F1 score of 81.8.","['squad', 'stanford question answering dataset', 'reading comprehension', 'attention', 'text convolutions', 'question answering']"

We introduce a novel algorithm, RESIDUAL LOSS PREDICTION (RESLOPE), that solves such problems by automatically learning an internal representation of a denser reward function. RESLOPE operates as a reduction to contextual bandits, using its learned loss representation to solve the credit assignment problem, and a contextual bandit oracle to trade-off exploration and exploitation. RESLOPE enjoys a no-regret reduction-style theoretical guarantee and outperforms state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms in both MDP environments and bandit structured prediction settings.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Structured Prediction', 'Contextual Bandits', 'Learning Reduction']"
7,ryALZdAT-,Feature Incay for Representation Regularization,"Softmax-based loss is widely used in deep learning for multi-class classification, where each class is represented by a weight vector and each sample is represented as a feature vector. Different from traditional learning algorithms where features are pre-defined and only weight vectors are tunable through training, feature vectors are also tunable as representation learning in deep learning. Thus we investigate how to improve the classification performance by better adjusting the features. One main observation is that elongating the feature norm of both correctly-classified and mis-classified feature vectors improves learning: (1) increasing the feature norm of correctly-classified examples induce smaller training loss; (2) increasing the feature norm of mis-classified examples can upweight the contribution from hard examples. Accordingly, we propose feature incay to regularize representation learning by encouraging larger feature norm. In contrast to weight decay which shrinks the weight norm, feature incay is proposed to stretch the feature norm. Extensive empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and LFW demonstrate the effectiveness of feature incay. ","['feature norm', 'regularization', 'softmax loss', 'feature incay']"
8,SkERSm-0-,Preliminary theoretical troubleshooting in Variational Autoencoder,"What would be learned by variational autoencoder(VAE) and what influence the disentanglement of VAE? This paper tries to preliminarily address VAE's intrinsic dimension, real factor, disentanglement and indicator issues theoretically in the idealistic situation and implementation issue practically through noise modeling perspective in the realistic case.  On intrinsic dimension issue, due to information conservation, the idealistic VAE learns and only learns intrinsic factor dimension. Besides, suggested by mutual information separation property, the constraint induced by Gaussian prior to the VAE objective encourages the information sparsity in dimension. On disentanglement issue,   subsequently, inspired by information conservation theorem the clarification on disentanglement in this paper is made. On real factor issue, due to factor equivalence, the idealistic VAE possibly learns any factor set in the equivalence class.  On indicator issue, the behavior of current disentanglement metric is discussed, and several performance indicators regarding the disentanglement and generating influence are subsequently raised to evaluate the performance of VAE model and to supervise the used factors. On implementation issue, the experiments under noise modeling and constraints empirically testify the theoretical analysis and also show their own characteristic in pursuing disentanglement.","['variational autoencoder', 'information theory', 'noise modelling', 'representation learning', 'generative model', 'disentanglement']"
9,HknbyQbC-,Generating Adversarial Examples with Adversarial Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples resulting from adding small-magnitude perturbations to inputs. Such adversarial examples can mislead DNNs to produce adversary-selected results.
Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more efficiently requires more research efforts. 
In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. 
For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate adversarial training as defenses.  
We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly.
Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks. Our attack  has placed the first with 92.76% accuracy on a public MNIST black-box attack challenge. ","['adversarial examples', 'generative adversarial network', 'black-box attack']"
10,rkxY-sl0W,Tree-to-tree Neural Networks for Program Translation,"Program translation is an important tool to migrate legacy code in one language into an ecosystem built in a different language. In this work, we are the first to consider employing deep neural networks toward tackling this problem. We observe that program translation is a modular procedure, in which a sub-tree of the source tree is translated into the corresponding target sub-tree at each step. To capture this intuition, we design a tree-to-tree neural network as an encoder-decoder architecture to translate a source tree into a target one. Meanwhile, we develop an attention mechanism for the tree-to-tree model, so that when the decoder expands one non-terminal in the target tree, the attention mechanism locates the corresponding sub-tree in the source tree to guide the expansion of the decoder. We evaluate the program translation capability of our tree-to-tree model against several state-of-the-art approaches. Compared against other neural translation models, we observe that our approach is consistently better than the baselines with a margin of up to 15 points. Further, our approach can improve the previous state-of-the-art program translation approaches by a margin of 20 points on the translation of real-world projects.",[]

We then propose \textit{linearly constrained weights (LCW)} to reduce the angle bias in a neural network, so as to train the network under the constraints that the sum of the elements of each weight vector is zero. A reparameterization technique is presented to efficiently train a model with LCW by embedding the constraints on weight vectors into the structure of the network. Interestingly, batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) can be viewed as a mechanism to correct angle bias. Preliminary experiments show that LCW helps train a 100-layered MLP more efficiently than does batch normalization.","['vanishing gradient problem', 'multilayer perceptron', 'angle bias']"
12,SyrGJYlRZ,YellowFin and the Art of Momentum Tuning,"Hyperparameter tuning is one of the most time-consuming workloads in deep learning. State-of-the-art optimizers, such as AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam, reduce this labor by adaptively tuning an individual learning rate for each variable. Recently researchers have shown renewed interest in simpler methods like momentum SGD as they may yield better results. Motivated by this trend, we ask: can simple adaptive methods, based on SGD perform as well or better? We revisit the momentum SGD algorithm and show that hand-tuning a single learning rate and momentum makes it competitive with Adam. We then analyze its robustness to learning rate misspecification and objective curvature variation. Based on these insights, we design YellowFin, an automatic tuner for momentum and learning rate in SGD. YellowFin optionally uses a negative-feedback loop to compensate for the momentum dynamics in asynchronous settings on the fly. We empirically show YellowFin can converge in fewer iterations than Adam on ResNets and LSTMs for image recognition, language modeling and constituency parsing, with a speedup of up to $3.28$x in synchronous and up to $2.69$x in asynchronous settings.","['adaptive optimizer', 'momentum', 'hyperparameter tuning']"
13,Hk2MHt-3-,Coupled Ensembles of Neural Networks,"We investigate in this paper the architecture of deep convolutional networks. Building on existing state of the art models, we propose a reconfiguration of the model parameters into several parallel branches at the global network level, with each branch being a standalone CNN. We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters while at the same time improving the performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization. In addition to splitting the parameters into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by averaging their log-probabilities. The tighter coupling favours the learning of better representations, even at the level of the individual branches, as compared to when each branch is trained independently. We refer to this branched architecture as ""coupled ensembles"". The approach is very generic and can be applied with almost any neural network architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC and parameter budget of 25M, we obtain error rates of 2.92%, 15.68% and 1.50% respectively on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN tasks. For the same parameter budget, DenseNet-BC has an error rate of 3.46%, 17.18%, and 1.8% respectively.  With ensembles of coupled ensembles, of DenseNet-BC networks, with 50M total parameters, we obtain error rates of 2.72%, 15.13% and 1.42% respectively on these tasks.","['Ensemble learning', 'neural networks']"

However, relatively little work has explored the internal structure and properties of spaces of sentence vectors. In this paper, we will explore the properties of sentence vectors by studying a particular real-world application: Automatic Summarization. In particular, we show that cosine similarity between sentence vectors and document vectors is strongly correlated with sentence importance and that vector semantics can identify and correct gaps between the sentences chosen so far and the document. In addition, we identify specific dimensions which are linked to effective summaries. To our knowledge, this is the first time specific dimensions of sentence embeddings have been connected to sentence properties. We also compare the features of different methods of sentence embeddings. Many of these insights have applications in uses of sentence embeddings far beyond summarization.","['Sentence Vectors', 'Vector Semantics', 'Automatic Summarization']"

The existence of super-convergence is relevant to understanding why deep networks generalize well.  One of the key elements of super-convergence is training with cyclical learning rates and a large maximum learning rate.  Furthermore, we present evidence that training with large learning rates improves performance by regularizing the network. In addition, we show that super-convergence provides a  greater boost in performance relative to standard training when the amount of labeled training data is limited.  We also derive a simplification of the Hessian Free optimization method to compute an estimate of the optimal learning rate.  The architectures to replicate this work will be made available upon publication.

16,ryH_bShhW,DOUBLY STOCHASTIC ADVERSARIAL AUTOENCODER,"Any autoencoder network can be turned into a generative model by imposing an arbitrary prior distribution on its hidden code vector. Variational Autoencoder uses a KL divergence penalty to impose the prior, whereas Adversarial Autoencoder uses generative adversarial networks.  A straightforward modification of Adversarial Autoencoder can be achieved by replacing the adversarial network with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) network. This replacement leads to a new set of probabilistic autoencoder which is also discussed in our paper.

However, an essential challenge remains in both of these probabilistic autoencoders, namely that the only source of randomness at the output of encoder, is the training data itself.  Lack of enough stochasticity can make the optimization problem non-trivial. As a result, they can lead to degenerate solutions where the generator collapses into sampling only a few modes.

Our proposal is to replace the adversary of the adversarial autoencoder by a space of {\it stochastic} functions. This replacement introduces a a new source of randomness which can be considered as a continuous control for encouraging {\it explorations}. This prevents the adversary from fitting too closely to the generator and therefore leads to more diverse set of generated samples. Consequently, the decoder serves as a better generative network which unlike MMD nets scales linearly with the amount of data. We provide mathematical and empirical evidence on how this replacement outperforms the pre-existing architectures.

17,ryj0790hb,Incremental Learning through Deep Adaptation,"Given an existing trained neural network, it is often desirable to learn new capabilities without hindering performance of those already learned. Existing approaches either learn sub-optimal solutions, require joint training, or incur a substantial increment in the number of parameters for each added task, typically as many as the original network. We propose a method called Deep Adaptation Networks (DAN) that constrains newly learned filters to be linear combinations of existing ones. DANs preserve performance on the original task, require a fraction (typically 13%) of the number of parameters compared to standard fine-tuning procedures and converge in less cycles of training to a comparable or better level of performance. When coupled with standard network quantization techniques, we further reduce the parameter cost to around 3% of the original with negligible or no loss in accuracy. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains. We conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our method on a range of image classification tasks and explore different aspects of its behavior.","['Transfer Learning', 'Learning without forgetting', 'Multitask Learning']"
18,SkiCjzNTZ,Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Deep Neural Networks,"We propose a framework to understand the unprecedented performance and robustness of deep neural networks using field theory. Correlations between the weights within the same layer can be described by symmetries in that layer, and networks generalize better if such symmetries are broken to reduce the redundancies of the weights. Using a two parameter field theory, we find that the network can break such symmetries itself towards the end of training in a process commonly known in physics as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers to break the symmetry, but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limit applicable to residual networks (He et al., 2015), we show that the remnant symmetries that survive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken based on empirical results. The Lagrangian for the non-linear and weight layers together has striking similarities with the one in quantum field theory of a scalar. Using results from quantum field theory we show that our framework is able to explain many experimentally observed phenomena, such as training on random labels with zero error (Zhang et al., 2017), the information bottleneck and the phase transition out of it (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017), shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017), and many more.","['deep learning', 'physics', 'field theory']"

20,rkA1f3NpZ,Ensemble Methods as a Defense to Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks,"Deep learning has become the state of the art approach in many machine learning problems such as classification. It has recently been shown that deep learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Taking the camera systems of self-driving cars as an example, small adversarial perturbations can cause the system to  make errors in important tasks, such as classifying traffic signs or detecting pedestrians. Hence, in order to use deep learning without safety concerns a proper defense strategy is required. We propose to use ensemble methods as a defense strategy against adversarial perturbations. We find that an attack leading one model to misclassify does not imply the same for other networks performing the same task. This makes ensemble methods an attractive defense strategy against adversarial attacks. We empirically show for the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 data sets that ensemble methods not only improve the accuracy of neural networks on test data but also increase their robustness against adversarial perturbations.","['Ensemble Method', 'Adversarial Perturbations', 'Deep Neural Networks', 'Defense', 'Attack']"

22,r15kjpHa-,Reward Design in Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Packet Routing,"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), how to design a suitable reward signal to accelerate learning and stabilize convergence is a critical problem. The global reward signal assigns the same global reward to all agents without distinguishing their contributions, while the local reward signal provides different local rewards to each agent based solely on individual behavior. Both of the two reward assignment approaches have some shortcomings: the former might encourage lazy agents, while the latter might produce selfish agents.

In this paper, we study reward design problem in cooperative MARL based on packet routing environments. Firstly, we show that the above two reward signals are prone to produce suboptimal policies. Then, inspired by some observations and considerations, we design some mixed reward signals, which are off-the-shelf to learn better policies. Finally, we turn the mixed reward signals into the adaptive counterparts, which achieve best results in our experiments. Other reward signals are also discussed in this paper. As reward design is a very fundamental problem in RL and especially in MARL, we hope that MARL researchers can rethink the rewards used in their systems.","['Reward Design', 'Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning', 'Packet Routing']"

Using FBA with ITD, we can transform the VBP into a more biologically plausible approach for learning deep neural network architectures.

models for up-sampling, including encoder-decoder networks for
semantic segmentation and deep generative models for unsupervised
learning. One of the key limitations of deconvolutional operations
is that they result in the so-called checkerboard problem. This is
caused by the fact that no direct relationship exists among adjacent
pixels on the output feature map. To address this problem, we
propose the pixel deconvolutional layer (PixelDCL) to establish
direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature
map. Our method is based on a fresh interpretation of the regular
deconvolution operation. The resulting PixelDCL can be used to
replace any deconvolutional layer in a plug-and-play manner without
compromising the fully trainable capabilities of original models.
The proposed PixelDCL may result in slight decrease in efficiency,
but this can be overcome by an implementation trick. Experimental
results on semantic segmentation demonstrate that PixelDCL can
consider spatial features such as edges and shapes and yields more
accurate segmentation outputs than deconvolutional layers. When used

automatically expanded architectures converge to similar topologies that benefit
from lesser amount of parameters or improved accuracy and exhibit systematic

Looking at auto-encoders from this signal recovery perspective enables us to have a more coherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that the true hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the weight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \ell^{2} $ row length and the bias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data mean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in hidden signals increases.

brain, we introduce the first deep neural network architecture for modeling Egocentric
Spatial Memory (ESM). It learns to estimate the pose of the agent and
progressively construct top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views in a spatially
extended environment. During the exploration, our proposed ESM network
model updates belief of the global map based on local observations using a recurrent
neural network. It also augments the local mapping with a novel external
memory to encode and store latent representations of the visited places based on
their corresponding locations in the egocentric coordinate. This enables the agents
to perform loop closure and mapping correction. This work contributes in the
following aspects: first, our proposed ESM network provides an accurate mapping
ability which is vitally important for embodied agents to navigate to goal locations.
In the experiments, we demonstrate the functionalities of the ESM network in
random walks in complicated 3D mazes by comparing with several competitive
baselines and state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms. Secondly, we faithfully hypothesize the functionality and the working
mechanism of navigation cells in the brain. Comprehensive analysis of our model
suggests the essential role of individual modules in our proposed architecture and
demonstrates efficiency of communications among these modules. We hope this
work would advance research in the collaboration and communications over both
fields of computer science and computational neuroscience.","['spatial memory', 'egocentric vision', 'deep neural network', 'navigation']"
33,ry9tUX_6-,Entropy-SGD optimizes the prior of a PAC-Bayes bound: Data-dependent PAC-Bayes priors via differential privacy,"We show that Entropy-SGD (Chaudhari et al., 2017), when viewed as a learning algorithm, optimizes a PAC-Bayes bound on the risk of a Gibbs (posterior) classifier, i.e., a randomized classifier obtained by a risk-sensitive perturbation of the weights of a learned classifier. Entropy-SGD works by optimizing the bound’s prior, violating the hypothesis of the PAC-Bayes theorem that the prior is chosen independently of the data. Indeed, available implementations of Entropy-SGD rapidly obtain zero training error on random labels and the same holds of the Gibbs posterior. In order to obtain a valid generalization bound, we show that an ε-differentially private prior yields a valid PAC-Bayes bound, a straightforward consequence of results connecting generalization with differential privacy. Using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to approximate the well-known exponential release mechanism, we observe that generalization error on MNIST (measured on held out data) falls within the (empirically nonvacuous) bounds computed under the assumption that SGLD produces perfect samples. In particular, Entropy-SGLD can be configured to yield relatively tight generalization bounds and still fit real labels, although these same settings do not obtain state-of-the-art performance.","['generalization error', 'neural networks', 'statistical learning theory', 'PAC-Bayes theory']"

and data mining applications. Although using more complex and advanced
classifiers can help to improve the accuracy of classification systems, it can be
done by analyzing data sets and their features for a particular problem. Feature
combination is the one which can improve the quality of the features. In this paper,
a structure similar to Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is used to generate an
optimized linear or non-linear combination of features for classification. Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is applied to update weights and biases. Since nature of data sets
and their features impact on the effectiveness of combination and classification
system, linear and non-linear activation functions (or transfer function) are used
to achieve more reliable system. Experiments of several UCI data sets and using
minimum distance classifier as a simple classifier indicate that proposed linear and
non-linear intelligent FFNN-based feature combination can present more reliable
and promising results. By using such a feature combination method, there is no

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised technique that addresses both these issues simultaneously. We learn dense representations from large unlabelled image datasets, then use those representations to both learn classifiers from small labeled sets and generate visual rationales explaining the predictions. Using chest radiography diagnosis as a motivating application, we show our method has good generalization ability by learning to represent our chest radiography dataset while training a classifier on an separate set from a different institution. Our method identifies heart failure and other thoracic diseases. For each prediction, we generate visual rationales for positive classifications by optimizing a latent representation to minimize the probability of disease while constrained by a similarity measure in image space. Decoding the resultant latent representation produces an image without apparent disease. The difference between the original and the altered image forms an interpretable visual rationale for the algorithm's prediction.

It consists of utilizing two different models. A predefined number of non-linear transform models are used in the learning stage, and one sparsifying transform model is used at test time. The non-linear transform models have discriminative and minimum information loss priors. A novel measure related to the discriminative prior is proposed and defined on the support intersection for the transform representations. The minimum information loss prior is expressed as a constraint on the conditioning and the expected coherence of the transform matrix. An equivalence between the non-linear models and the sparsifying model is shown only when the measure that is used to define the discriminative prior goes to zero. An approximation of the measure used in the discriminative prior is addressed, connecting it to a similarity concentration. To quantify the discriminative properties of the transform representation, we introduce another measure and present its bounds. Reflecting the discriminative quality of the transform representation we name it as discrimination power. 

To support and validate the theoretical analysis a practical learning algorithm is presented. We evaluate the advantages and the potential of the proposed algorithm by a computer simulation. A favorable performance is shown considering the execution time, the quality of the representation, measured by the discrimination power and the recognition accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods of the same category.","['transform learning', 'sparse representation', 'discrimininative prior', 'information preservation', 'discrimination power']"

Rather than directly using discretized information, input data is first projected into a high-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where it can be modeled as a continuous function using a series of kernel bases. We then proceed to derive a closed-form solution to the continuous convolution operation between two arbitrary functions operating in different RKHS. Within this framework, convolutional filters also take the form of continuous functions, and the training procedure involves learning the RKHS to which each of these filters is projected, alongside their weight parameters. This results in much more expressive filters, that do not require spatial discretization and benefit from properties such as adaptive support and non-stationarity. Experiments on image classification are performed, using classical datasets, with results indicating that the proposed continuous convolutional neural network is able to achieve competitive accuracy rates with far fewer parameters and a faster convergence rate.","['convolutional neural networks', 'image classification', 'deep learning', 'feature representation', 'hilbert maps', 'reproducing kernel hilbert space']"

This leads to the nonidentifiability of the event times’ distribution parameters, which makes the problem significantly more challenging. In this work we introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network, a novel Siamese Deep Neural Network architecture that is able to effectively learn from data in the presence of multiple adverse events. The Siamese Survival Network is especially crafted to issue pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, in which longer event times are assigned lower risks. Furthermore, our architecture is able to directly optimize an approximation to the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics of cross-entropy etc., and which are not able to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing risks.

For instance, this is the case in an image search engine. We consider the Single Logit Classification (SLC) task: training the network so that at test-time, it would be possible to accurately identify if the example belongs to a given class, based only on the output logit for this class. 
We propose a natural principle, the Principle of Logit Separation, as a guideline for choosing and designing losses suitable for the SLC. 
We show that the cross-entropy loss function is not aligned with the Principle of Logit Separation. In contrast, there are known loss functions, as well as novel batch loss functions that we propose, which are aligned with this principle. In total, we study seven loss functions. 
Our experiments show that indeed in almost all cases, losses that are aligned with Principle of Logit Separation obtain a 20%-35% relative performance improvement in the SLC task, compared to losses that are not aligned with it. We therefore conclude that the Principle of Logit Separation sheds light on an important property of the most common loss functions used by neural network classifiers. ",[]

Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss.

The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network. However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks. Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification.

We propose a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. This results in structures allowing neurons to connect to neurons in any deeper layer skipping intermediate layers. Moreover, neurons in deeper layers encode low-order (small condition sets) independencies and have a wide scope of the input, whereas neurons in the first layers encode higher-order (larger condition sets) independencies and have a narrower scope. Thus, the depth of the network is automatically determined---equal to the maximal order of independence in the input distribution, which is the recursion-depth of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm constructs two main graphical models: 1) a generative latent graph (a deep belief network) learned from data and 2) a deep discriminative graph constructed from the generative latent graph. We prove that conditional dependencies between the nodes in the learned generative latent graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph. Finally, a deep neural network structure is constructed based on the discriminative graph.

This approach is applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint distribution of outputs.","['semantic segmentation', 'conditional denoising autoencoders', 'iterative inference']"

We introduce a novel automated countermeasure called Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) to thwart the potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. The proposed PCL methodology is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to build/train parallel checkpointing learners. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint checkpointing modules are trained and leveraged to validate the victim model execution in parallel. Each checkpointing learner explicitly characterizes the geometry of the input data and the corresponding high-level data abstractions within a particular DL layer. As such, the adversary is required to simultaneously deceive all the defender modules in order to succeed.

64,S1xDcSR6W,Hybed: Hyperbolic Neural Graph Embedding,"Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where they provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph-based tasks, embeddings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been learned.
However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but a negatively curved hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that hyperbolic embeddings significantly outperform Euclidean embeddings on vertex classification tasks for several real-world public datasets.

Our approach expands on the Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN) by outlining some of the short-comings of the original energy and loss functions. We address these short-comings by incorporating an l1 score, the Gradient Magnitude Similarity score, and a chrominance score into the new energy function. We then provide a set of systematic experiments that explore its hyper-parameters. We show that each of the energy function's components is able to represent a slightly different set of features, which require their own evaluation criteria to assess whether they have been adequately learned. We show that models using the new energy function are able to produce better image representations than the BEGAN model in predicted ways.","['generative adversarial networks', 'gans', 'deep learning', 'image modeling', 'image generation', 'energy based models']"

In this carefully controlled setting, we are able to describe the specific form of the optimal solution to the minimisation problem of the training step. We show that the autoencoder indeed approximates this solution during training. Secondly, we identify a clear failure in the generalisation capacity of the autoencoder, namely its inability to interpolate data. Finally, we explore several regularisation schemes to resolve the generalisation problem. Given the great attention that has been recently given to the generative capacity of neural networks, we believe that studying in depth simple geometric cases sheds some light on the generation process and can provide a minimal requirement experimental setup for more complex architectures.

We derive policy gradients where the change in policy is limited to a small Wasserstein distance (or trust region). This is done in the discrete and continuous multi-armed bandit settings with entropy regularisation. We show that in the small steps limit with respect to the Wasserstein distance $W_2$, policy dynamics are governed by the heat equation, following the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto result. This means that policies undergo diffusion and advection, concentrating near actions with high reward. This helps elucidate the nature of convergence in the probability matching setup, and provides justification for empirical practices such as Gaussian policy priors and additive gradient noise.","['Optimal transport', 'policy gradients', 'entropy regularization', 'reinforcement learning', 'heat equation', 'Wasserstein', 'JKO', 'gradient flows']"
69,S1lN69AT-,"To Prune, or Not to Prune: Exploring the Efficacy of Pruning for Model Compression","Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.","['pruning', 'model sparsity', 'model compression', 'deep learning']"

We make contributions to this issue by considering a modified version of the fully connected layer we call a block diagonal inner product layer. These modified layers have weight matrices that are block diagonal, turning a single fully connected layer into a set of densely connected neuron groups. This idea is a natural extension of group, or depthwise separable, convolutional layers applied to the fully connected layers. Block diagonal inner product layers can be achieved by either initializing a purely block diagonal weight matrix or by iteratively pruning off diagonal block entries. This method condenses network storage and speeds up the run time without significant adverse effect on the testing accuracy, thus offering a new approach to improve network computation efficiency.","['Deep Learning', 'Neural Networks']"

We generalize this method into a framework (ArbNets) that allows for efficient arbitrary weight-sharing, and use it to study the role of weight-sharing in neural networks. We show that common neural networks can be expressed as ArbNets with different hash functions. We also present two novel hash functions, the Dirichlet hash and the Neighborhood hash, and use them to demonstrate experimentally that balanced and deterministic weight-sharing helps with the performance of a neural network.","['Weight-sharing', 'Weight sharing', 'Weight tying', 'neural networks', 'entropy', 'hash function', 'hash table', 'balance', 'sparse', 'sparsity', 'hashednets']"
73,rk1FQA0pW,End-to-End Abnormality Detection in Medical Imaging,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown promising performance in computer vision. In medical imaging, encouraging results have been achieved with deep learning for applications such as segmentation, lesion detection and classification. Nearly all of the deep learning based image analysis methods work on reconstructed images, which are obtained from original acquisitions via solving inverse problems (reconstruction). The reconstruction algorithms are designed for human observers, but not necessarily optimized for DNNs which can often observe features that are incomprehensible for human eyes. Hence, it is desirable to train the DNNs directly from the original data which lie in a different domain with the images. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging. To align the acquisition with the annotations made by radiologists in the image domain, a DNN was built as the unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms to map the acquisitions to images, and followed by a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the abnormality in the reconstructed images. The two networks were trained jointly in order to optimize the entire DNN for the detection task from the original acquisitions. The DNN was implemented for lung nodule detection in low-dose chest computed tomography (CT), where a numerical simulation was done to generate acquisitions from 1,018 chest CT images with radiologists' annotations. The proposed end-to-end DNN demonstrated better sensitivity and accuracy for the task compared to a two-step approach, in which the reconstruction and detection DNNs were trained separately. A significant reduction of false positive rate on suspicious lesions were observed, which is crucial for the known over-diagnosis in low-dose lung CT imaging. The images reconstructed by the proposed end-to-end network also presented enhanced details in the region of interest.

It provides an adequate description of the morphology of text, as it is able to represent prefixes, declensions, and inflections with similar vectors and are able to represent even unseen words on the training dataset. Similarly, as it is compact yet sparse, is ideal for speed up training times using tensor processing libraries. As part of this paper, we show that this technique is especially effective when coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text classification at character-level. We apply two variants of CNN coupled with it. Experimental results show that it drastically reduces the number of parameters to be optimized, resulting in competitive classification accuracy values in only a fraction of the time spent by one-hot encoding representations, thus enabling training in commodity hardware.","['Character Level Convolutional Networks', 'Text Classification', 'Word Compressing']"

However, RNN still has a limited capacity to manipulate long-term memory.  To bypass this weakness the most successful applications of RNN use external techniques such as attention mechanisms. In this paper we propose a novel RNN model that unifies the state-of-the-art approaches: Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM). The core of RUM is its rotational operation, which is,  naturally,  a unitary matrix, providing architectures with the power to learn long-term dependencies by overcoming the vanishing and exploding gradients problem.  Moreover,  the rotational unit also serves as associative memory. We evaluate our model on synthetic memorization, question answering and language modeling tasks.   RUM learns the Copying Memory task completely and improves the state-of-the-art result in the Recall task.  RUM’s performance in the bAbI Question Answering task is comparable to that of models with attention mechanism. We also improve the state-of-the-art result to 1.189 bits-per-character (BPC) loss in the Character Level Penn Treebank (PTB) task, which is to signify the applications of RUM to real-world sequential data.

We also show how to train such a neural network as a deep multi-layer autoencoder, jointly minimizing both classification and reconstruction losses.

In experiments, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms almost all networks without residual connections on benchmark datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN. Given sufficient amount of data as in SVHN dataset, CrescendoNet with 15 layers and 4.1M parameters can match the performance of DenseNet-BC with 250 layers and 15.3M parameters. CrescendoNet provides a new way to construct high performance deep convolutional neural networks without residual connections. Moreover, through investigating the behavior and performance of subnetworks in CrescendoNet, we note that the high performance of CrescendoNet may come from its implicit ensemble behavior, which differs from the FractalNet that is also a deep convolutional neural network without residual connections. Furthermore, the independence between paths in CrescendoNet allows us to introduce a new path-wise training procedure, which can reduce the memory needed for training.","['CNN', 'ensemble', 'image recognition']"

Such predictors can address the growing computational problem of DNNs by automatically adjusting to varying test-time budgets. In this work, we study a \emph{general} augmentation to feed-forward networks to form anytime neural networks (ANNs) via auxiliary predictions and losses. Specifically, we point out a blind-spot in recent studies in such ANNs: the importance of high final accuracy. In fact, we show on multiple recognition data-sets and architectures that by having near-optimal final predictions in small anytime models, we can effectively double the speed of large ones to reach corresponding accuracy level. We achieve such speed-up with simple weighting of anytime losses that oscillate during training. We also assemble a sequence of exponentially deepening ANNs, to achieve both theoretically and practically near-optimal anytime results at any budget, at the cost of a constant fraction of additional consumed budget.","['anytime', 'neural network', 'adaptive prediction', 'budgeted prediction']"

In this paper, we emphasize that two-player zero-sum games with alternating turns, which have been previously formulated as Alternating Markov Games (AMGs), are different from standard MDP because of their two-agent nature. We exploit the difference in associated Bellman equations, which leads to different policy iteration algorithms. As policy gradient method is a kind of generalized policy iteration, we show how these differences in policy iteration are reflected in policy gradient for AMGs. We formulate an adversarial policy gradient and discuss potential possibilities for developing better policy gradient methods other than self-play REINFORCE. The core idea is to estimate the minimum rather than the mean for the “critic”. Experimental results on the game of Hex show the modified Monte Carlo policy gradient methods are able to learn better pure neural net policies than the REINFORCE variants. To apply learned neural weights to multiple board sizes Hex, we describe a board-size independent neural net architecture.

While adaptive algorithms, such as Adam and RMSprop, have shown better optimization performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in many scenarios, they often lead to worse generalization performance than SGD, when used for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we identify two problems regarding the direction and step size for updating the weight vectors of hidden units, which may degrade the generalization performance of Adam. As a solution, we propose the normalized direction-preserving Adam (ND-Adam) algorithm, which controls the update direction and step size more precisely, and thus bridges the generalization gap between Adam and SGD. Following a similar rationale, we further improve the generalization performance in classification tasks by regularizing the softmax logits. By bridging the gap between SGD and Adam, we also shed some light on why certain optimization algorithms generalize better than others.","['optimization', 'generalization', 'Adam', 'SGD']"

image classfication, natural language processing or speech recognition. Most of the state-of-the art deep networks have complex architecture and use a vast number of parameters to reach this superior performance. Though these networks use a large number of learnable parameters, those parameters present significant redundancy. Therefore, it is possible to compress the network without much affecting its accuracy by eliminating those redundant and unimportant parameters.
In this work, we propose a three stage compression pipeline, which consists of pruning, weight sharing and quantization to compress deep neural networks.
Our novel pruning technique combines magnitude based ones with dense sparse dense ideas and iteratively finds for each layer its achievable sparsity instead of selecting a single threshold for the whole network.
Unlike previous works, where compression is only applied on networks performing classification, we evaluate and perform compression on networks for classification as well as semantic segmentation, which is greatly useful for understanding scenes in autonomous driving.
We tested our method on LeNet-5 and FCNs, performing classification and semantic segmentation, respectively. With LeNet-5 on MNIST, pruning reduces the number of parameters by 15.3 times and storage requirement from 1.7 MB to 0.006 MB with accuracy loss of 0.03%.

As the title of the paper by Mirowski et al. (2016) suggests, one might assume that DRL-based algorithms are able to “learn to navigate” and are thus ready to replace classical mapping and path-planning algorithms, at least in simulated environments. Yet, from experiments and analysis in this earlier work, it is not clear what strategies are used by these algorithms in navigating the mazes and finding the goal. In this paper, we pose and study this underlying question: are DRL algorithms doing some form of mapping and/or path-planning? Our experiments show that the algorithms are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage. Hence, the DRL algorithms fall short of qualifying as mapping or path-planning algorithms with any reasonable definition of mapping. We extend the experiments in Mirowski et al. (2016) by separating the set of training and testing maps and by a more ablative coverage of the space of experiments. Our systematic experiments show that the NavA3C-D1-D2-L algorithm, when trained and tested on the same maps, is able to choose the shorter paths to the goal. However, when tested on unseen maps the algorithm utilizes a wall-following strategy to find the goal without doing any mapping or path planning.","['deep reinforcement learning', 'navigation', 'path-planning', 'mapping']"

In addition, the fully convolutional discriminator enables the semi-supervised learning through discovering the trustworthy regions in prediction results of unlabeled images, providing additional supervisory signals.

89,SylJ1D1C-,PDE-Net: Learning PDEs from Data,"Partial differential equations (PDEs)  play a prominent role in many disciplines such as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, material science, computer science, etc. PDEs are commonly derived based on physical laws or empirical observations. However, the governing equations for many complex systems in modern applications are still not fully known. With the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of hidden physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. The basic idea of the proposed PDE-Net is to learn differential operators by learning convolution kernels (filters), and apply neural networks or other machine learning methods to approximate the unknown nonlinear responses. Comparing with existing approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is known or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential operators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). We also discuss relations of the PDE-Net with some existing networks in computer vision such as Network-In-Network (NIN) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.","['deep convolution network', 'partial differential equation', 'physical laws']"

Despite their promising performances on many tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine intelligence. One is that CNNs are complex and hard to interpret. Another is that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes very hard to obtain, and it is desirable to be able to learn them from few examples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing novel, simple, and interpretable models for few-shot learn- ing. Our models are based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts, which are interpretable visual cues represented by the feature vectors within CNNs. We first adapt the learning of visual concepts to the few-shot setting, and then uncover two key properties of feature encoding using visual concepts, which we call category sensitivity and spatial pattern. Motivated by these properties, we present two intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that our models achieve competitive performances, while being much more flexible and interpretable than alternative state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We conclude that using visual concepts helps expose the natural capability of CNNs for few-shot learning.","['Few-Shot Learning', 'Neural Network Understanding', 'Visual Concepts']"

thanks to artificial deep neural networks that achieved a great success in many
machine learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech

to easily crafted adversarial examples. Many investigations have pointed out this
fact and different approaches have been proposed to generate attacks while adding
a limited perturbation to the original data. The most robust known method so far
is the so called C&W attack [1]. Nonetheless, a countermeasure known as fea-
ture squeezing coupled with ensemble defense showed that most of these attacks
can be destroyed [6]. In this paper, we present a new method we call Centered
Initial Attack (CIA) whose advantage is twofold : first, it insures by construc-
tion the maximum perturbation to be smaller than a threshold fixed beforehand,
without the clipping process that degrades the quality of attacks. Second, it is
robust against recently introduced defenses such as feature squeezing, JPEG en-
coding and even against a voting ensemble of defenses. While its application is
not limited to images, we illustrate this using five of the current best classifiers
on ImageNet dataset among which two are adversarialy retrained on purpose to
be robust against attacks. With a fixed maximum perturbation of only 1.5% on
any pixel, around 80% of attacks (targeted) fool the voting ensemble defense and

It is closely related to sequence-to-sequence models, which learn fixed-sized latent representations for sequences, and have been applied to a number of challenging supervised sequence tasks such as machine translation, as well as unsupervised representation learning for sequences.
In contrast to sequences, sets are permutation invariant. The proposed set autoencoder considers this fact, both with respect to the input as well as the output of the model. On the input side, we adapt a recently-introduced recurrent neural architecture using a content-based attention mechanism. On the output side, we use a stable marriage algorithm to align predictions to labels in the learning phase.
We train the model on synthetic data sets of point clouds and show that the learned representations change smoothly with translations in the inputs, preserve distances in the inputs, and that the set size is represented directly. We apply the model to supervised tasks on the point clouds using the fixed-size latent representation.

We report on a new modular network architecture that applies an attentional mechanism not on temporal and spatial regions of the input, but on sensor selection for multi-sensor setups. This network called the sensor transformation attention network (STAN) is evaluated in scenarios which include the presence of natural noise or synthetic dynamic noise. We demonstrate how the attentional signal responds dynamically to changing noise levels and sensor-specific noise, leading to reduced word error rates (WERs) on both audio and visual tasks using TIDIGITS and GRID; and also on CHiME-3, a multi-microphone real-world noisy dataset. The improvement grows as more channels are corrupted as demonstrated on the CHiME-3 dataset. Moreover, the proposed STAN architecture naturally introduces a number of advantages including ease of removing sensors from existing architectures, attentional interpretability, and increased robustness to a variety of noise environments.","['attention', 'sensor-selection', 'multi-sensor', 'natural noise']"

The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely-connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators.

Variational inference provides one way to approximate the posterior distribution, however its expressive power is limited and so is the accuracy of resulting approximation. Recently, there has a trend of using neural networks to approximate the variational posterior distribution due to the flexibility of neural network architecture. One way to construct flexible variational distribution is to warp a simple density into a complex by normalizing flows, where the resulting density can be analytically evaluated. However, there is a trade-off between the flexibility of normalizing flow and computation cost for efficient transformation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture of normalizing flows, ConvFlow, based on convolution over the dimensions of random input vector.

This poses the question of how to compactly represent all the information that the population codes carry across all these dimensions. Here, we developed an analytical method to factorize a large number of retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a robust low-dimensional representation that captures efficiently both their spatial and temporal information. In particular, we extended previously used single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity. On data recorded from retinal ganglion cells with strong pre-stimulus baseline, we showed that in situations were the stimulus elicits a strong change in firing rate, our extensions yield a boost in stimulus decoding performance. Our results thus suggest that taking into account the baseline can be important for finding a compact information-rich representation of neural activity.","['Space-by-time non-negative matrix factorization', 'dimensionality reduction', 'baseline correction', 'neuronal decoding', 'mutual information']"

Existing algorithms suffer from many limitations, such as unpredictable disentangling factors, bad quality of generated images from encodings, lack of identity information, etc. In this paper, we proposed a supervised algorithm called DNA-GAN trying to disentangle different attributes of images. The latent representations of images are DNA-like, in which each individual piece represents an independent factor of variation. By annihilating the recessive piece and swapping a certain piece of two latent representations, we obtain another two different representations which could be decoded into images. In order to obtain realistic images and also disentangled representations, we introduced the discriminator for adversarial training.

In this paper, we introduce intrinsic fear, a learned reward shaping that accelerates deep reinforcement learning and guards oscillating policies against periodic catastrophes. Our approach incorporates a second model trained via supervised learning to predict the probability of imminent catastrophe. This score acts as a penalty on the Q-learning objective. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the perturbed objective yields the same average return under strong assumptions and an $\epsilon$-close average return under weaker assumptions. Our analysis also shows robustness to classification errors.

To address this cost, a number of quantization schemeshave been proposed - but most of these techniques focused on quantizing weights, which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This paper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training - that enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and activations without any significant accuracy degradation.  This technique, PArameterized Clipping acTi-vation (PACT), uses an activation clipping parameter α that is optimized duringtraining to find the right quantization scale. PACT allows quantizing activations toarbitrary bit precisions, while achieving much better accuracy relative to publishedstate-of-the-art quantization schemes. We show, for the first time, that both weights and activations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving accuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models and datasets. We also show that exploiting these reduced-precision computational units in hardware can enable a super-linear improvement in inferencing performance dueto a significant reduction in the area of accelerator compute engines coupled with the ability to retain the quantized model and activation data in on-chip memories.","['deep learning', 'quantized deep neural network', 'activation quantization']"

To achieve this so-called grounded language learning, models must overcome certain well-studied learning challenges that are also fundamental to infants learning their first words. While it is notable that models with no meaningful prior knowledge overcome these learning obstacles, AI researchers and practitioners currently lack a clear understanding of exactly how they do so. Here we address this question as a way of achieving a clearer general understanding of grounded language learning, both to inform future research and to improve confidence in model predictions. For maximum control and generality, we focus on a simple neural network-based language learning agent trained via policy-gradient methods to interpret synthetic linguistic instructions in a simulated 3D world. We apply experimental paradigms from developmental psychology to this agent, exploring the conditions under which established human biases and learning effects emerge.

The recent introduction of Disguised Face Identification (DFI) framework proves the applicability of deep neural networks for this very problem. All the ATMs nowadays incorporate a hidden camera in them and capture the footage of their users. However, it is impossible for the police to track down the impersonators with disguised faces from the ATM footage. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is trained to identify, in real time, whether the user in the captured image is trying to cloak his identity or not. The output of the DCNN is then reported to the ATM to take appropriate steps and prevent the swindler from completing the transaction. The network is trained using a dataset of images captured in similar situations as of an ATM. The comparatively low background clutter in the images enables the network to demonstrate high accuracy in feature extraction and classification for all the different disguises.","['Deep Convolutional Neural Network', 'Disguised Face Identification', 'Fraudulent Transaction', 'ATM', 'Impersonation;']"

In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization, it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately). On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that plague DDPG. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on several continuous control tasks.","['Reinforcement learning', 'continuous control', 'deep learning']"

Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output.

110,Syl3_2JCZ,A Self-Organizing Memory Network,"Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the `  null space' of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn  memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.

111,S1m6h21Cb,The Cramer Distance as a Solution to Biased Wasserstein Gradients,"The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community. Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes. The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling, and most recently in reinforcement learning. In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence suggesting this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cramér distance. We show that the Cramér distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences. We give empirical results on a number of domains comparing these three divergences. To illustrate the practical relevance of the Cramér distance we design a new algorithm, the Cramér Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it has a number of desirable properties over the related Wasserstein GAN.

Cloud-based training schemes provide beneficial services but suffer from potential privacy risks due to excessive user data collection. To enable cloud-based DNN training while protecting the data privacy simultaneously, we propose to leverage the intermediate representations of the data, which is achieved by splitting the DNNs and deploying them separately onto local platforms and the cloud. The local neural network (NN) is used to generate the feature representations. To avoid local training and protect data privacy, the local NN is derived from pre-trained NNs. The cloud NN is then trained based on the extracted intermediate representations for the target learning task. We validate the idea of DNN splitting by characterizing the dependency of privacy loss and classification accuracy on the local NN topology for a convolutional NN (CNN) based image classification task. Based on the characterization, we further propose PrivyNet to determine the local NN topology, which optimizes the accuracy of the target learning task under the constraints on privacy loss, local computation, and storage.

We believe that IL algorithm could be more applicable to the real-world environments if the number of interactions could be reduced. To this end, we propose a model free, off-policy IL algorithm for continuous control.

Regularization can be implicit, as is the case of stochastic gradient descent or parameter sharing in convolutional layers, or explicit. Most common explicit regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, reduce the effective capacity of the model and typically require the use of deeper and wider architectures to compensate for the reduced capacity. Although these techniques have been proven successful in terms of results, they seem to waste capacity. In contrast, data augmentation techniques reduce the generalization error by increasing the number of training examples and without reducing the effective capacity. In this paper we systematically analyze the effect of data augmentation on some popular architectures and conclude that data augmentation alone---without any other explicit regularization techniques---can achieve the same performance or higher as regularized models, especially when training with fewer examples.","['deep learning', 'data augmentation', 'regularization']"

The neural topic component encodes information from the source sentence to build a global “topic” distribution over words, which is then consulted by the seq2seq model to improve generation at each time step. The experimental results show that the proposed LTCM can generate more diverse and interesting responses by sampling from its learnt latent representations. In a subjective human evaluation, the judges also confirm that LTCM is the preferred option comparing to competitive baseline models.

The fixed-length vector can therefore represent features only in the selected dimensions. In addition, we propose using rolling fixed window approach to generate samples. The change of time series features over time can be summarised as a smooth trajectory path.

The proposed sparse-complementary convolution replaces regular convolution with sparse and complementary shapes of kernels, covering the same receptive field. 
By the nature of deep learning, high model utilization of a CNN can be achieved with more simpler kernels rather than fewer complex kernels.
This simple but insightful model reuses of recent network architectures, ResNet and DenseNet, can provide better accuracy for most classification tasks (CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet) compared to their baseline models. By simply replacing the convolution of a CNN with our sparse-complementary convolution, at the same FLOPs and parameters, we can improve top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 0.33% and 0.18% for ResNet-101 and ResNet-152, respectively.

Both have negative values, allowing them to push mean unit activation closer to zero, and bring the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient, ensuring a noise- robust deactivation state, lessening the over fitting risk. The significant performance advantage of ISRLU on traditional CPUs also carry over to more efficient HW implementations on HW/SW codesign for CNNs/RNNs. In experiments with TensorFlow, ISRLU leads to faster learning and better generalization than ReLU on CNNs. This work also suggests a computationally efficient variant called the “inverse square root unit” (ISRU) which can be used for RNNs. Many RNNs use either long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) which are implemented with tanh and sigmoid activation functions.

Our model simultaneously optimises both the composition function and the parser, thus eliminating the need for externally-provided parse trees which are normally required for Tree-LSTM. It can therefore be seen as a tree-based RNN that is unsupervised with respect to the parse trees. As it is fully differentiable, our model is easily trained with an off-the-shelf gradient descent method and backpropagation. We demonstrate that it achieves better performance compared to various supervised Tree-LSTM architectures on a textual entailment task and a reverse dictionary task.

We present an alternate view to explain the success of LSTMs: the gates themselves are powerful recurrent models that provide more representational power than previously appreciated. We do this by showing that the LSTM's gates can be decoupled from the embedded S-RNN, producing a restricted class of RNNs where the main recurrence computes an element-wise weighted sum of context-independent functions of the inputs. Experiments on a range of challenging NLP problems demonstrate that the simplified gate-based models work substantially better than S-RNNs, and often just as well as the original LSTMs, strongly suggesting that the gates are doing much more in practice than just alleviating vanishing gradients.",[]

We demonstrate this methods effectiveness by designing an optimized heat sink and both 2D and 3D airfoils that maximize the lift drag ratio under steady state flow conditions. We highlight that our method has two distinct benefits over other automated design approaches. First, evaluating the neural networks prediction of fitness can be orders of magnitude faster then simulating the system of interest. Second, using gradient decent allows the design space to be searched much more efficiently then other gradient free methods.

While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. 
We present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network. Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation. By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.  Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that applied to the popular VGG and ResNet architectures, our methods significantly reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers (about 65% space savings) while negligibly impacting accuracy.","['tensor contraction', 'tensor regression', 'network compression', 'deep neural networks']"

We propose a simple way to resolve this issue by decoupling weight decay and the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) 
decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam, and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).
We also demonstrate that longer optimization runs require smaller weight decay values for optimal results and introduce a normalized variant of weight decay to reduce this dependence.

We also propose strategies to decouple the number of queries required to generate each adversarial sample from the dimensionality of the input. An iterative variant of our attack achieves close to 100% adversarial success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks on DNNs. We carry out extensive experiments for a thorough comparative evaluation of black-box attacks and show that the proposed Gradient Estimation attacks outperform all transferability based black-box attacks we tested on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving adversarial success rates similar to well known, state-of-the-art white-box attacks.

It is difficult to learn neural networks which will generalize to problem instances that are much larger than those used during training. Furthermore, even when the learned neural program empirically works on all test inputs, we cannot verify that it will work on every possible input. Recent work has shown that it is possible to address these issues by using recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter, but this technique requires a verification set which is difficult to construct without knowledge of the internals of the oracle used to generate training data. In this work, we show how to automatically build such a verification set, which can also be directly used for training. By interactively querying an oracle, we can construct this set with minimal additional knowledge about the oracle. We empirically demonstrate that our method allows automated learning and verification of a recursive NPI program with provably perfect generalization.

To address this, we develop feature-matching autoencoders (FMAEs). FMAEs ensure that the marginal distribution of feature layers are preserved across forward and inverse mappings between domains. We show that FMAEs achieve state of the art for data efficiency and alignment across three tasks: text decipherment, sentiment transfer, and neural machine translation for English-to-German and English-to-French. Most compellingly, FMAEs achieve state of the art for neural translation with limited supervision, with significant BLEU score differences of up to 5.7 and 6.3 over traditional supervised models.

We show both theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in Markov social dilemmas.

Toward solving the problem, the de facto approach is to employ a sequence-to-sequence-style model. Such an approach will necessarily require the SQL queries to be serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent serializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the choice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the ""order-matters"" problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations. However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is limited.
    
In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally solve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the order does not matter. In particular, we employ a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph, so that one prediction can be done by taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In addition, we propose a sequence-to-set model as well as the column attention mechanism to synthesize the query based on the sketch.

Our method treats all training features from a deep neural network as radial basis function centres and computes loss by summing the influence of a feature's nearby centres in the embedding space. Having a radial basis function centred on each training feature is made scalable by treating it as an approximate nearest neighbour search problem. End-to-end learning of the network and solver is carried out, mapping high dimensional features into clusters of the same class. This results in a well formed embedding space, where semantically related instances are likely to be located near one another, regardless of whether or not the network was trained on those classes. The same loss function is used for both the metric learning and classification problems. We show that our radial basis function solver outperforms state-of-the-art embedding approaches on the Stanford Cars196 and CUB-200-2011 datasets.

However, DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high depths, and in applications like fully convolutional networks, full DenseNet connections are prohibitively expensive. 
This work first experimentally shows that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet,  only slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to  ($1 + \log_2 L$), but uses only $L\log_2 L$ total connections instead of $O(L^2)$. Hence, \logdenses are easier to scale than DenseNets, and no longer require careful GPU memory management.

We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes.

RAML incorporates task-specific reward by performing maximum-likelihood updates on candidate outputs sampled according to an exponentiated payoff distribution, which gives higher probabilities to candidates that are close to the reference output. While RAML is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and its impressive empirical successes, the theoretical properties of RAML, especially the behavior of the exponentiated payoff distribution, has not been examined thoroughly.

The softmax Q-distribution can be regarded as a smooth approximation of the Bayes decision boundary, and the Bayes decision rule is achieved by decoding with this Q-distribution. We further show that RAML is equivalent to approximately estimating the softmax Q-distribution, with the temperature $\tau$ controlling approximation error. We perform two experiments, one on synthetic data of multi-class classification and one on real data of image captioning, to demonstrate the relationship between RAML and the proposed softmax Q-distribution estimation, verifying our theoretical analysis.

With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data (i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images randomly selected from the training set, we can generate N^2 new samples from N training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show that our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of samples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more valuable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical imaging tasks.

Vaswani et. al. (2017) propose a new architecture that avoids recurrence and convolution completely. Instead, it uses only self-attention and feed-forward layers. While the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks, it requires a large number of parameters and training iterations to converge. We propose Weighted Transformer, a Transformer with modified attention layers, that not only outperforms the baseline network in BLEU score but also converges 15-40% faster. Specifically, we replace the multi-head attention by multiple self-attention branches that the model learns to combine during the training process. Our model improves the state-of-the-art performance by 0.5 BLEU points on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and by 0.4 on the English-to-French translation task.","['transformer', 'branching', 'attention', 'machine translation']"

Under this framework, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices of the prior over parameters. This provides us a very general way to interpolate between generative and discriminative extremes through different choices of priors. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from \emph{both} source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model,  \emph{DAuto}. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.

We suggest one advantage of this particular type of memory is the ability to easily assign credit to a specific state when remembered information is found to be useful. Inspired by this idea, and the increasing popularity of external memory mechanisms to handle long-term dependencies in deep learning systems, we propose a novel algorithm which uses a reservoir sampling procedure to maintain an external memory consisting of a fixed number of past states. The algorithm allows a deep reinforcement learning agent to learn online to preferentially remember those states which are found to be useful to recall later on. Critically this method allows for efficient online computation of gradient estimates with respect to the write process of the external memory. Thus unlike most prior mechanisms for external memory it is feasible to use in an online reinforcement learning setting.

Earlier works have developed natural language processing techniques to extract concept annotations and/or clinical narratives from doctor notes. However, these approaches are slow and do not use the accompanying medical time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the problem of concept annotation for the medical time series data, i.e., the task of predicting and localizing medical concepts by using the time series data as input. We propose Relational Multi-Instance Learning (RMIL) - a deep Multi Instance Learning framework based on recurrent neural networks, which uses pooling functions and attention mechanisms for the concept annotation tasks.

However, directly augmenting in the image domain may not necessarily generate training data that sufficiently explore the intra-class space for one-shot classification. Inspired by the recent vocabulary-informed learning, we propose to generate synthetic training data with the guide of the semantic word space. Essentially, we train an auto-encoder as a bridge to enable the transformation between the image feature space and the semantic space. Besides directly augmenting image features, we transform the image features to semantic space using the encoder and perform the data augmentation. The decoder then synthesizes the image features for the augmented instances from the semantic space. Experiments on three datasets show that our data augmentation method effectively improves the performance of one-shot classification. An extensive study shows that data augmented from semantic space are complementary with those from the image space, and thus boost the classification accuracy dramatically.

The parameter domain of the loss surface can be decomposed into regions in which activation values (zero or one for rectified linear units) are consistent. We found that, in each region, the loss surface have properties similar to that of linear neural networks where every local minimum is a global minimum. This means that every differentiable local minimum is the global minimum of the corresponding region. We prove that for a neural network with one hidden layer using rectified linear units under realistic assumptions. There are poor regions that lead to poor local minima, and we explain why such regions exist even in the overparameterized DNNs.","['neural network', 'local minima', 'global minima', 'saddle point', 'optimization', 'loss surface', 'rectified linear unit', 'loss surface decomposition', 'gradient descent']"
167,r1kP7vlRb,Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient,"Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult. In a such situation, learning a metric of a sequence from data is one possible solution. The previous study, SeqGAN, proposed the framework for unsupervised sequence generation, in which a metric is learned from data, and a generator is optimized with regard to the learned metric with policy gradient, inspired by generative adversarial nets (GANs) and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we make two proposals to learn better metric than SeqGAN's: partial reward function and expert-based reward function training. The partial reward function is a reward function for a partial sequence of a certain length. SeqGAN employs a reward function for completed sequence only. By combining long-scale and short-scale partial reward functions, we expect a learned metric to be able to evaluate a partial correctness as well as a coherence of a sequence, as a whole. In expert-based reward function training, a reward function is trained to discriminate between an expert (or true) sequence and a fake sequence that is produced by editing an expert sequence. Expert-based reward function training is not a kind of GAN frameworks. This makes the optimization of the generator easier. We examine the effect of the partial reward function and expert-based reward function training on synthetic data and real text data, and show improvements over SeqGAN and the model trained with MLE. Specifically, whereas SeqGAN gains 0.42 improvement of NLL over MLE on synthetic data, our best model gains 3.02 improvement, and whereas SeqGAN gains 0.029 improvement of BLEU over MLE, our best model gains 0.250 improvement.","['sequence generation', 'reinforcement learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'RNN']"

In this setting, can an adversary obtain the private samples if the classification model is given to the adversary? We call this reverse engineering against the classification model the Classifier-to-Generator (C2G) Attack. This situation arises when the classification model is embedded into mobile devices for offline prediction (e.g., object recognition for the automatic driving car and face recognition for mobile phone authentication).
For C2G attack, we introduce a novel GAN, PreImageGAN. In PreImageGAN, the generator is designed to estimate the the sample distribution conditioned by the preimage of classification model $f$, $P(X|f(X)=y)$, where $X$ is the random variable on the sample space and $y$ is the probability vector representing the target label arbitrary specified by the adversary. In experiments, we demonstrate PreImageGAN works successfully with hand-written character recognition and face recognition. In character recognition, we show that, given a recognition model of hand-written digits, PreImageGAN allows the adversary to extract alphabet letter images without knowing that the model is built for alphabet letter images. In face recognition, we show that, when an adversary obtains a face recognition model for a set of individuals, PreImageGAN allows the adversary to extract face images of specific individuals contained in the set, even when the adversary has no knowledge of the face of the individuals.","['Security', 'Privacy', 'Model Publication', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']"

In the first part, we show that a simple modification of gradient descent algorithm can converge to a global minimizer of the subproblem with an asymptotic linear convergence rate. Moreover, our method only requires Hessian-vector products, which can be computed efficiently by back-propagation in neural networks. In the second part, we apply our algorithm to train large-scale convolutional neural networks, such as VGG and MobileNets. Although trust region method is about 3 times slower than SGD in terms of running time, we observe it finds a model that has lower generalization (test) error than SGD, and this difference is even more significant in large batch training.

Unfortunately they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbations can transfer across models: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead other unseen models. Consequently  the adversary can leverage it to attack against the deployed black-box systems. 
In this work, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into two components: model-specific and data-dependent one, and it is the latter that mainly contributes to the transferability. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to craft adversarial examples by utilizing the noise reduced gradient (NRG) which approximates the data-dependent component. Experiments on various classification models trained on ImageNet demonstrates that the new approach enhances the transferability dramatically. We also find that low-capacity models have more powerful attack capability than high-capacity counterparts, under the condition that they have comparable test performance.  These insights give rise to a principled manner to construct adversarial examples with high success rates and could potentially provide us guidance for designing effective defense approaches against black-box attacks.

Nevertheless, datasets often exhibit rich structures in practice, and we argue that there exist some unknown orders within the data instances. Aiming to find such orders, we introduce a novel Generative Markov Network (GMN) which we use to extract the order of data instances automatically. Specifically, we assume that the instances are sampled from a Markov chain. Our goal is to learn the transitional operator of the chain as well as the generation order by maximizing the generation probability under all possible data permutations. One of our key ideas is to use neural networks as a soft lookup table for approximating the possibly huge, but discrete transition matrix. This strategy allows us to amortize the space complexity with a single model and make the transitional operator generalizable to unseen instances. To ensure the learned Markov chain is ergodic, we propose a greedy batch-wise permutation scheme that allows fast training.  Empirically, we evaluate the learned Markov chain by showing that GMNs are able to discover orders among data instances and also perform comparably well to state-of-the-art methods on the one-shot recognition benchmark task.","['Markov chain', 'discovering orders', 'generative model', 'one-shot']"

It overcomes the ill-conditioning of the recurrent matrix by enforcing soft unitary constraints on the factors. Thanks to the small dimensionality of the factors, maintaining these constraints is computationally efficient. Our experimental results on seven standard data-sets reveal that KRU can reduce the number of parameters by three orders of magnitude in the recurrent weight matrix compared to the existing recurrent models, without trading the statistical performance. These results in particular show that while there are advantages in having a high dimensional recurrent space, the capacity of the recurrent part of the model can be dramatically reduced.","['Recurrent neural network', 'Vanishing and exploding gradients', 'Parameter efficiency', 'Kronecker matrices', 'Soft unitary constraint']"

We model such a process of unit selection as an Indian Buffet Process, and derive a simplified objective function via the MAP asymptotic technique. The induced binary optimization problem is efficiently solved with a continuous relaxation method by attaching a Switch Gate layer to the hidden layers of interest. The resulted interpreter model is thus end-to-end optimized via standard gradient back-propagation. Experiments are conducted with two popular deep convolutional classifiers, respectively well-trained on the MNIST dataset and the CI- FAR10 dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed interpreter successfully finds the core hidden units most responsible for prediction making.

Besides, this interpreter model is also able to extract the most informative pixels in the images by connecting a Switch Gate layer to the input layer.

In image classification tasks, for example, averaging the predictions for multiple patches extracted from the input image significantly improves accuracy. Using multiple networks trained independently to make predictions improves accuracy further. One obvious drawback of the ensembling technique is its higher execution cost during inference.% If we average 100 local predictions, the execution cost will be 100 times as high as the cost without the ensemble. This higher cost limits the real-world use of ensembling. In this paper, we first describe our insights on relationship between the probability of the prediction and the effect of ensembling with current deep neural networks; ensembling does not help mispredictions for inputs predicted with a high probability, i.e. the output from the softmax. This finding motivates us to develop a new technique called adaptive ensemble prediction, which achieves the benefits of ensembling with much smaller additional execution costs. Hence, we calculate the confidence level of the prediction for each input from the probabilities of the local predictions during the ensembling computation. If the prediction for an input reaches a high enough probability on the basis of the confidence level, we stop ensembling for this input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated the adaptive ensembling by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the computation cost significantly while achieving similar accuracy to the naive ensembling. We also showed that our statistically rigorous confidence-level-based termination condition reduces the burden of the task-dependent parameter tuning compared to the naive termination based on the pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with the same cost.

Studies in these topics show that starting with a small training set and adding new samples according to difficulty levels improves the learning performance. In this paper we experimented that we can also obtain good results by adding the samples randomly without a meaningful order. We compared our method with classical training, Curriculum learning, Self paced learning and their reverse ordered versions. Results of the statistical tests show that the proposed method is better than classical method and similar with the others.

192,HkpRBFxRb,Learning to Mix n-Step Returns: Generalizing Lambda-Returns for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) can model complex behavior policies for goal-directed sequential decision making tasks. A hallmark of RL algorithms is Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using the next state's value function. lambda-returns define the target of the RL agent as a weighted combination of rewards estimated by using multiple many-step look-aheads. Although mathematically tractable, the use of  exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our major contribution  is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. In contrast to lambda-returns wherein the RL agent is restricted to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme, CAR allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. Our experiments, in addition to showing the efficacy of CAR, also empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the  Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'Lambda-Returns']"

research interest. However, most of the well-established approaches,
such as hypothesis capacity, stability or sparseness, have not provided complete
explanations (Zhang et al., 2016; Kawaguchi et al., 2017). In this work, we focus
on the robustness approach (Xu & Mannor, 2012), i.e., if the error of a hypothesis
will not change much due to perturbations of its training examples, then it
will also generalize well. As most deep learning algorithms are stochastic (e.g.,
Stochastic Gradient Descent, Dropout, and Bayes-by-backprop), we revisit the robustness
arguments of Xu & Mannor, and introduce a new approach – ensemble
robustness – that concerns the robustness of a population of hypotheses. Through
the lens of ensemble robustness, we reveal that a stochastic learning algorithm can
generalize well as long as its sensitiveness to adversarial perturbations is bounded
in average over training examples. Moreover, an algorithm may be sensitive to
some adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015) but still generalize well. To
support our claims, we provide extensive simulations for different deep learning
algorithms and different network architectures exhibiting a strong correlation between
ensemble robustness and the ability to generalize.","['Robustness', 'Generalization', 'Deep Learning', 'Adversarial Learning']"

Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures.  Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs.

The first results were impressive, GANs were shown to be able to generate samples in high dimensional structured spaces, like images and text, that were no copies of the training data. But generative and discriminative learning are quite different. Discriminative learning has a clear end, while generative modeling is an intermediate step to understand the data or generate hypothesis. The quality of implicit density estimation is hard to evaluate, because we cannot tell how well a data is represented by the model. How can we certainly say that a generative process is generating natural images with the same distribution as we do? In this paper, we noticed that even though GANs might not be able to generate samples from the underlying distribution (or we cannot tell at least), they are capturing some structure of the data in that high dimensional space. It is therefore needed to address how we can leverage those estimates produced by GANs in the same way we are able to use other generative modeling algorithms.","['Generative Modeling', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Density Estimation']"

More precisely, we construct a differentiable mapping from an image to a discrete tabular list of objects, where each object consists of a differentiable position, feature vector, and scalar presence value that allows the representation to be learnt using an attention mechanism.

Applying this mapping to Atari games, together with an interaction net-style architecture for calculating quantities from objects, we construct agents that can play Atari games using objects learnt in an unsupervised fashion. During training, many natural objects emerge, such as the ball and paddles in Pong, and the submarine and fish in Seaquest.

Representations of rare words trained directly on end tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained end-to-end for the downstream task. We show that this improves results against baselines where embeddings are trained on the end task for reading comprehension, recognizing textual entailment and language modeling.

Thus the network is aware not of the specific color object, but its colorfulness. The data set introduced in the paper consists of images showing crashed cars from which ten classes were extracted. An additional annotation was done which labeled whether the car shown was red or non-red.  The networks were evaluated by their performance on the classification task. With the color annotation we altered the color ratios  in the training data and analyzed the generalization capabilities of the networks on the unaltered test data. We further split the test data in red and non-red cars and did a similar evaluation.

202,HkbmWqxCZ,The Mutual Autoencoder: Controlling Information in Latent Code Representations,"Variational autoencoders (VAE) learn probabilistic latent variable models by optimizing a bound on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. Beyond providing a good density model a VAE model assigns to each data instance a latent code. In many applications, this latent code provides a useful high-level summary of the observation. However, the VAE may fail to learn a useful representation when the decoder family is very expressive. This is because maximum likelihood does not explicitly encourage useful representations and the latent variable is used only if it helps model the marginal distribution. This makes representation learning with VAEs unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a method for explicitly controlling the amount of information stored in the latent code. Our method can learn codes ranging from independent to nearly deterministic while benefiting from decoder capacity. Thus, we decouple the choice of decoder capacity and the latent code dimensionality from the amount of information stored in the code.

the depth of a network leads to a decrease in performance on both test and training data. Novel architectures such as ResNets and Highway networks have addressed this issue by introducing various flavors of skip-connections or gating mechanisms. However, the degradation problem persists in the context of plain feed-forward networks. In this work we propose a simple method to address this issue. The proposed method poses the learning of weights in deep networks as a constrained optimization problem where the presence of skip-connections is penalized by Lagrange multipliers. This allows for skip-connections to be introduced during the early stages of training and subsequently phased out in a principled manner. We demonstrate the benefits of such an approach with experiments on MNIST, fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 where the proposed method is shown to greatly decrease the degradation effect (compared to plain networks) and is often competitive with ResNets.","['optimization', 'vanishing gradients', 'shattered gradients', 'skip-connections']"

Deep neural networks have recently been successful in a range of computer vision tasks and provide a way to represent the features of images. In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating the structure of human categories that draws on ideas from both cognitive science and machine learning, blending human-based algorithms with state-of-the-art deep representation learners.

While adversarial training improves the robustness of classifiers against such adversarial perturbations, it leaves classifiers sensitive to them on a non-negligible fraction of the inputs. We argue that there are two different kinds of adversarial perturbations: shared perturbations which fool a classifier on many inputs and singular perturbations which only fool the classifier on a small fraction of the data. We find that adversarial training increases the robustness of classifiers against shared perturbations. Moreover, it is particularly effective in removing universal perturbations, which can be seen as an extreme form of shared perturbations. Unfortunately, adversarial training does not consistently increase the robustness against singular perturbations on unseen inputs. However, we find that adversarial training decreases robustness of the remaining perturbations against image transformations such as changes to contrast and brightness or  Gaussian blurring. It thus makes successful attacks on the classifier in the physical world less likely. Finally, we show that even singular perturbations can be easily detected and must thus exhibit generalizable patterns even though the perturbations are specific for certain inputs.

Both of these approaches provide expressive models to which backpropagation can be applied for training. We then consider entropy bonus, which is typically added to the reward function to enhance exploration. In the case of high-dimensional action spaces, calculating the entropy and the gradient of the entropy requires enumerating all the actions in the action space and running forward and backpropagation for each action, which may be computationally infeasible. We develop several novel unbiased estimators for the entropy bonus and its gradient.

novel classes is particularly small. We present a simple yet powerful distillation
method where the base network is augmented with additional weights to classify
the novel classes, while keeping the weights of the base network unchanged. We
term this learning hard distillation, since we preserve the response of the network
on the old classes to be equal in both the base and the expanded network. We
show that since only a small number of weights needs to be trained, the hard
distillation excels for low-shot training scenarios. Furthermore, hard distillation
avoids detriment to classification performance on the base classes. Finally, we
show that low-shot network expansion can be done with a very small memory

In order to obtain sample-specific features, we extract the intermediate feature maps from an autoencoder.

These coefficients are used to linearly combine the base filters from a filter repository to generate the final filters for a CNN.

We show that for a wide class of differentiable activation functions (this class involves most nonlinear functions and excludes piecewise linear functions), we have that arbitrary first-order optimal solutions satisfy global optimality provided the hidden layer is non-singular. We essentially show that these non-singular hidden layer matrix satisfy a ``""good"" property for these big class of activation functions. Techniques involved in proving this result inspire us to look at a new algorithmic, where in between two gradient step of hidden layer, we add a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step of the output layer. In this new algorithmic framework, we extend our earlier result and show that for all finite iterations the hidden layer satisfies the``good"" property mentioned earlier therefore partially explaining success of noisy gradient methods and addressing the issue of data independency of our earlier result. Both of these results are easily extended to hidden layers given by a flat matrix from that of a square matrix. Results are applicable even if network has more than one hidden layer provided all inner hidden layers are arbitrary, satisfy non-singularity, all activations are from the given class of differentiable functions and optimization is only with respect to the outermost hidden layer. Separately, we also study the smoothness properties of the objective function and show that it is actually Lipschitz smooth, i.e., its gradients do not change sharply.

However, in one-class classification task, only data from one class are available. To build an robust outlier detector using only data from a positive class, we propose a corrupted GAN(CorGAN), a deep convolutional Generative Adversary Network requiring no convergence during training. In the adversarial process of training CorGAN, the Generator is supposed to generate outlier samples for negative class, and the Discriminator as an one-class classifier is trained to distinguish data from training datasets (i.e. positive class) and generated data from the Generator (i.e. negative class). To improve the performance of the Discriminator (one-class classifier), we also propose a lot of techniques to improve the performance of the model.

Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric autoencoder term that allows reliable predictors for the easy tasks to have high contribution to the feature learning while suppressing the influences of unreliable predictors for more difficult tasks. This allows the learning of less noisy representations, and enables unreliable predictors to exploit knowledge from the reliable predictors via the shared latent features. Such asymmetric knowledge transfer through shared features is also more scalable and efficient than inter-task asymmetric transfer. We validate our Deep-AMTFL model on multiple benchmark datasets for multitask learning and image classification, on which it significantly outperforms existing symmetric and asymmetric multitask learning models, by effectively preventing negative transfer in deep feature learning.",[]

For specific domains, such as biomedicine, the long time and high expertise required for the development of manually annotated corpora explain that most of the existing one are relatively small (i.e., hundreds of sentences). Beside, larger corpora focusing on general or domain-specific relationships (such as citizenship or drug-drug interactions) have been developed. In this paper, we study how large annotated corpora developed for alternative tasks may improve the performances on biomedicine related tasks, for which few annotated resources are available. We experiment two deep learning-based models to extract relationships from biomedical texts with high performance. The first one combine locally extracted features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, while the second exploit the syntactic structure of sentences using a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Our experiments show that, contrary to the former, the latter benefits from a cross-corpus learning strategy to improve the performance of relationship extraction tasks. Indeed our approach leads to the best published performances for two biomedical RE tasks, and to state-of-the-art results for two other biomedical RE tasks, for which few annotated resources are available (less than 400 manually annotated sentences). This may be particularly impactful in specialized domains in which training resources are scarce, because they would benefit from the training data of other domains for which large annotated corpora does exist.

Other than these two sources of information, our model does not have any prior

We develop an attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion of visual and textual
modalities that allows the agent to learn to complete the navigation tasks and also
achieve language grounding. Our experimental results show that our attention
mechanism outperforms the existing multi-modal fusion mechanisms proposed in
order to solve the above mentioned navigation task. We demonstrate through the
visualization of attention weights that our model learns to correlate attributes of
the object referred in the instruction with visual representations and also show
that the learnt textual representations are semantically meaningful as they follow
vector arithmetic and are also consistent enough to induce translation between instructions
in different natural languages. We also show that our model generalizes

The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components. Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units. For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner. In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel. In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases. These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing. Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections. We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity. We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks.

However, general guidance to network architecture design is still missing. In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress (>50%) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.","['deep convolutional network', 'residual network', 'dynamic system', 'stochastic dynamic system', 'modified equation']"

The encoder will give almost identical representations to multilingual versions of the same text. This means that labeled data in one language can be used to train a classifier that works for the rest of the languages.

(2) The generator (G) is formulated as a continuous function, and the input noise is derived from a connected set, due to which G's output is a connected set. If G covers all modes, then there must be some portion of G's output which connects them. This corresponds to undesirable, conflated images. We develop theoretical arguments to support these intuitions. We propose a novel method to break the second assumption via learnable discontinuities in the latent noise space. Equivalently, it can be viewed as training several generators, thus creating discontinuities in the G function.

Learners such as One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVMs) have been successfully in anomaly detection, yet their performance may degrade significantly in the presence of sophisticated adversaries, who target the algorithm itself by compromising the integrity of the training data. With the rise in the use of machine learning in mission critical day-to-day activities where errors may have significant consequences, it is imperative that machine learning systems are made secure. To address this, we propose a defense mechanism that is based on a contraction of the data, and we test its effectiveness using OCSVMs. The proposed approach introduces a layer of uncertainty on top of the OCSVM learner, making it infeasible for the adversary to guess the specific configuration of the learner. We theoretically analyze the effects of adversarial perturbations on the separating margin of OCSVMs and provide empirical evidence on several benchmark datasets, which show that by carefully contracting the data in low dimensional spaces, we can successfully identify adversarial samples that would not have been identifiable in the original dimensional space. The numerical results show that the proposed method improves OCSVMs performance significantly (2-7%)","['anomaly detection', 'one class support vector machine', 'adversarial learning']"

258,HyPpD0g0Z,Grouping-By-ID: Guarding Against Adversarial Domain Shifts,"When training a deep neural network for supervised image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification of class Y. Following the notation of Gong et al. (2016), we can divide features broadly into the classes of (i) “core” or “conditionally invariant” features X^ci whose distribution P(X^ci | Y) does not change substantially across domains and (ii) “style” or “orthogonal” features X^orth whose distribution P(X^orth | Y) can change substantially across domains. These latter orthogonal features would generally include features such as position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color or posture for images of persons. We try to guard against future adversarial domain shifts by ideally just using the “conditionally invariant” features for classification. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable. We can hence not directly see the distributional change of features across different domains. 

We do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable. We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person. In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image. The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.

We provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al. (2016). However, we are interested in settings where we cannot observe the domain directly and we treat domain as a latent variable. If two or more samples share the same class and identifier, (Y, ID)=(y,i), then we treat those samples as counterfactuals under different style interventions on the orthogonal or style features. Using this grouping-by-ID approach, we regularize the network to provide near constant output across samples that share the same ID by penalizing with an appropriate graph Laplacian. This is shown to substantially improve performance in settings where domains change in terms of image quality, brightness, color changes, and more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture. We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness and transfer learning.","['supervised representation learning', 'causality', 'interpretability', 'transfer learning']"

MACH is the first generic $K$-classification algorithm, with provably theoretical guarantees, which requires $O(\log{K})$ memory without any assumption on the relationship between classes. MACH uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes to few independent classification task with very small (constant) number of classes.

With MACH we can train ODP dataset with 100,000 classes and 400,000 features on a single Titan X GPU (12GB), with the classification accuracy of 19.28\%, which is the best-reported accuracy on this dataset.

We do so through a student-teacher architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far without the need to retain the past data nor the past models. Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, the student model leverages the information learnt by the teacher, which acts as a summary of everything seen till now. The regularizer has the additional benefit of reducing the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over streaming data. We demonstrate its efficacy on streaming distributions as well as its ability to learn a common latent representation across a complex transfer learning scenario.

The proposed neighbor-encoder can be considered as a generalization of autoencoder as the input data can be treated as the nearest neighbor of itself with zero distance. By reformulating the representation learning problem as a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily incorporated with appropriate definition of similarity or distance between objects. As such, any existing similarity search algorithms can be easily integrated into our framework. Applications of other algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) in our framework is also possible since the concept of ``neighbor"" is an abstraction which can be appropriately defined differently in different contexts. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in various domains, including images, time series, music, etc., with various neighbor definitions.

264,HJ3d2Ax0-,Benefits of Depth for Long-Term Memory of Recurrent Networks,"The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a well established measure of RNNs' long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus formal understanding of their ability to correlate data throughout time is limited. Though depth efficiency in convolutional networks is well established by now, it does not suffice in order to account for the success of deep RNNs on inputs of varying lengths, and the need to address their 'time-series expressive power' arises. In this paper, we analyze the effect of depth on the ability of recurrent networks to express correlations ranging over long time-scales. To meet the above need, we introduce a measure of the information flow across time that can be supported by the network, referred to as the Start-End separation rank. Essentially, this measure reflects the distance of the function realized by the recurrent network from a function that models no interaction whatsoever between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are exponentially higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Moreover, we show that the ability of deep recurrent networks to correlate different parts of the input sequence increases exponentially as the input sequence extends, while that of vanilla shallow recurrent networks does not adapt to the sequence length at all. Thus, we establish that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of quantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), which merge the hidden state with the input via the Multiplicative Integration operation.","['recurrent neural networks', 'deep networks', 'correlations', 'long term memory', 'tensor networks', 'tensor analysis']"

On the multiple sequence copy task our RDA unit learns the task three

AFL learn such a representations by training the networks to deceive the adversary that predict the sensitive information from the network, and therefore, the success of the AFL heavily relies on the choice of the adversary. This paper proposes a novel design of the adversary, {\em multiple adversaries over random subspaces} (MARS) that instantiate the concept of the {\em volunerableness}.

While the novel approach is independent of the actual generative model, here we use two such models to investigate its applicability and scalability: a noisy-OR Bayes Net (as a standard example of binary data) and Binary Sparse Coding (as a model for continuous data).

Learning of probabilistic generative models is first formulated as approximate maximum likelihood optimization using variational expectation maximization (EM).
We choose truncated posteriors as variational distributions in which discrete latent states serve as variational parameters. In the variational E-step,
the latent states are then  
optimized according to a tractable free-energy objective. Given a data point, we can show that evolutionary algorithms can be used for the variational optimization loop by (A)~considering the bit-vectors of the latent states as genomes of individuals, and by (B)~defining the fitness of the
individuals as the (log) joint probabilities given by the used generative model.

As a proof of concept, we apply the novel evolutionary EM approach to the optimization of the parameters of noisy-OR Bayes nets and binary sparse coding on artificial and real data (natural image patches). Using point mutations and single-point cross-over for the evolutionary algorithm, we find that scalable variational EM algorithms are obtained which efficiently improve the data likelihood.

In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the communication cost by two orders of magnitude.",[]

architectures.  Although both convolutional and recurrent architectures have a
long history in sequence prediction, the current ""default"" mindset in much of
the deep learning community is that generic sequence modeling is best handled
using recurrent networks.  The goal of this paper is to question this assumption. 
Specifically, we consider a simple generic temporal convolution network (TCN),
which adopts features from modern ConvNet architectures such as a dilations and 
residual connections.  We show that on a variety of sequence modeling tasks,
including many frequently used as benchmarks for evaluating recurrent networks,
the TCN outperforms baseline RNN methods (LSTMs, GRUs, and vanilla RNNs) and
sometimes even highly specialized approaches.  We further show that the
potential ""infinite memory"" advantage that RNNs have over TCNs is largely
absent in practice: TCNs indeed exhibit longer effective history sizes than their 
recurrent counterparts.   As a whole, we argue that it may be time to (re)consider 
ConvNets as the default ""go to"" architecture for sequence modeling.","['Temporal Convolutional Network', 'Sequence Modeling', 'Deep Learning']"

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f(x) = x * sigmoid(beta * x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network. ","['meta learning', 'activation functions']"

We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points. We demonstrate that these degenerate local equilibria can be avoided with a gradient penalty scheme called DRAGAN. We show that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling performance across a variety of architectures and objective functions.","['GAN', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Mode Collapse', 'Stability', 'Game Theory', 'Regret Minimization', 'Convergence', 'Gradient Penalty']"

DANTE provides a distinct perspective in lieu of traditional gradient-based backpropagation techniques commonly used to train deep networks. It utilizes an adaptation of quasi-convex optimization techniques to cast autoencoder training as a bi-quasi-convex optimization problem. We show that for autoencoder configurations with both differentiable (e.g. sigmoid) and non-differentiable (e.g. ReLU) activation functions, we can perform the alternations very effectively. DANTE effortlessly extends to networks with multiple hidden layers and varying network configurations. In experiments on standard datasets, autoencoders trained using the proposed method were found to be very promising when compared to those trained using traditional backpropagation techniques, both in terms of training speed, as well as feature extraction and reconstruction performance.","['Deep Learning', 'Autoencoders', 'Alternating Optimization']"

However, the success is limited at more knowledge intensive tasks such as QA from a big corpus. Existing end-to-end deep QA models (Miller et al., 2016; Weston et al., 2014) need to read the entire text after observing the question, and therefore their complexity in responding a question is linear in the text size. This is prohibitive for practical tasks such as QA from Wikipedia, a novel, or the Web. We propose to solve this scalability issue by using symbolic meaning representations, which can be indexed and retrieved efficiently with complexity that is independent of the text size. More specifically, we use sequence-to-sequence models to encode knowledge symbolically and generate programs to answer questions from the encoded knowledge. We apply our approach, called the N-Gram Machine (NGM), to the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015) and a special version of them (“life-long bAbI”) which has stories of up to 10 million sentences. Our experiments show that NGM can successfully solve both of these tasks accurately and efficiently. Unlike fully differentiable memory models, NGM’s time complexity and answering quality are not affected by the story length. The whole system of NGM is trained end-to-end with REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). To avoid high variance in gradient estimation, which is typical in discrete latent variable models, we use beam search instead of sampling. To tackle the exponentially large search space, we use a stabilized auto-encoding objective and a structure tweak procedure to iteratively reduce and refine the search space.

The discriminator is then quickly able to classify nearly all generated samples as fake, leaving the generator without meaningful gradients and causing it to deteriorate after a point in training. In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.  Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.","['generative adversarial networks', 'stable training', 'low-dimensional projections', 'deep learning']"

In domains with high stakes (e.g., medical diagnosis), gaining insights into the network is critical for gaining trust and being adopted. One of the ways to improve interpretability of a NN is to explain the importance of a particular concept (e.g., gender) in prediction. This is useful for explaining reasoning behind the networks’ predictions, and for revealing any biases the network may have. This work aims to provide quantitative answers to \textit{the relative importance of concepts of interest} via concept activation vectors (CAV). In particular, this framework enables non-machine learning experts to express concepts of interests and  test hypotheses using examples (e.g., a set of pictures that illustrate  the concept). We show that CAV can be learned given a relatively small set of examples. Testing with CAV, for example, can answer whether a particular concept (e.g., gender) is more important in predicting a given class (e.g., doctor) than other set of concepts. Interpreting with CAV does not require any retraining or modification of the network. We show that many levels of meaningful concepts are learned (e.g., color, texture, objects, a person’s occupation), and we present CAV’s \textit{empirical deepdream} — where we maximize an activation using a set of example pictures. We show how various insights can be gained from the relative importance testing with CAV.",[]

We explore the training of deep vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with up to 144 layers, and show that bipolar activation functions help learning in this setting. On the Penn Treebank and Text8 language modeling tasks we obtain competitive results, improving on the best reported results for non-gated networks.

For efficient inference, normalizing flows have been recently developed to approximate a target distribution arbitrarily well. In practice, however, normalizing flows only consist of a finite number of deterministic transformations, and thus they possess no guarantee on the approximation accuracy. For density estimation, the generative adversarial network (GAN) has been advanced as an appealing model, due to its often excellent performance in generating samples. In this paper, we propose the concept of {\em continuous-time flows} (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit  energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.","['continuous-time flows', 'efficient inference', 'density estimation', 'deep generative models']"

We investigate the source of the performance gap, trace model deficiencies to some distinct properties of CLOTH, and identify the limited ability of comprehending a long-term context to be the key bottleneck.

In this paper, we investigate the behavior of deep neural networks on training sets with massively noisy labels. We show on multiple datasets such as MINST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet that successful learning is possible even with an essentially arbitrary amount of noise. For example, on MNIST we find that accuracy of above 90 percent is still attainable even when the dataset has been diluted with 100 noisy examples for each clean example. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when noisy labels are biased towards confusing classes. Further, we show how the required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise. Finally, we present simple actionable techniques for improving learning in the regime of high label noise.","['label noise', 'weakly supervised learning', 'robustness of neural networks', 'deep learning', 'large datasets']"

Truncated BPTT keeps the computational benefits of \emph{Backpropagation Through Time} (BPTT \cite{werbos:bptt}) while relieving the need for a complete backtrack through the whole data sequence at every step.  However, truncation favors short-term dependencies: the gradient estimate of truncated BPTT is biased, so that it does not benefit from the convergence guarantees from stochastic gradient theory. We introduce \emph{Anticipated Reweighted Truncated Backpropagation} (ARTBP), an algorithm that keeps the computational benefits of truncated BPTT, while providing unbiasedness. ARTBP works by using variable truncation lengths together with carefully chosen compensation factors in the backpropagation equation. We check the viability of ARTBP on two tasks. First, a simple synthetic task where careful balancing of temporal dependencies at different scales is needed: truncated BPTT displays unreliable performance, and in worst case scenarios, divergence, while ARTBP converges reliably. Second, on Penn Treebank character-level language modelling \cite{ptb_proc}, ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT.

Once an appropriate weight sharing architecture has been established, learning takes place through standard algorithms for feedforward networks, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variations. The method deals with meta-learning (such as domain adaptation, transfer and multi-task learning) in a unified fashion, and can easily deal with data arising from different types of sources.

These two types of information are usually represented in the form of word embeddings and compositional functions, respectively. For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Moreover, in a new SWEM setup, we propose to employ a max-pooling operation over the learned word-embedding matrix of a given sentence. This approach is demonstrated to extract complementary features relative to the averaging operation standard to SWEMs, while endowing our model with better interpretability. To further validate our observations, we examine the information utilized by different models to make predictions, revealing interesting properties of word embeddings.

We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a Bellman equation, making them naturally learnable from experience sampled from an environment. Moreover, the gradients of expected reward with respect to the mean and covariance of a parameterized Gaussian policy can be recovered from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these relationships we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value approximator. The approach is also amenable to proximal optimization techniques by augmenting the objective with a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy.

In other words, most images in the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research interest, the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we study a simple synthetic dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error and the average distance to nearest error. In particular, we prove that any model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size $O(1/\sqrt{d})$. Surprisingly, when we train several different architectures on this dataset, all of their error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory, the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed.

Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as either off-policy Q-learning, or on-policy policy gradient methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods.

We study the problem of building models that disentangle independent factors of variation. Such models encode features that can efficiently be used for classification and to transfer attributes between different images in image synthesis. As data we use a weakly labeled training set, where labels indicate what single factor has changed between two data samples, although the relative value of the change is unknown. This labeling is of particular interest as it may be readily available without annotation costs. We introduce an autoencoder model and train it through constraints on image pairs and triplets. We show the role of feature dimensionality and adversarial training theoretically and experimentally. We formally prove the existence of the reference ambiguity, which is inherently present in the disentangling task when weakly labeled data is used. The numerical value of a factor has different meaning in different reference frames. When the reference depends on other factors, transferring that factor becomes ambiguous. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed model can successfully transfer attributes on several datasets, but show also cases when the reference ambiguity occurs.

This highlights a key difficulty in designing an effective defense: the inability to assess a network's robustness against future attacks. We propose to address this difficulty through formal verification techniques. We construct ground truths: adversarial examples with a provably-minimal distance from a given input point. We demonstrate how ground truths can serve to assess the effectiveness of attack techniques, by comparing the adversarial examples produced by those attacks to the ground truths; and also of defense techniques, by computing the distance to the ground truths before and after the defense is applied, and measuring the improvement.

This framework emphasizes the need to consider latent-variable models along two dimensions: the ability to reconstruct inputs (distortion) and the communication cost (rate). We derive the optimal frontier of generative models in the two-dimensional rate-distortion plane, and show how the standard evidence lower bound objective is insufficient to select between points along this frontier. However, by performing targeted optimization to learn generative models with different rates, we are able to learn many models that can achieve similar generative performance but make vastly different trade-offs in terms of the usage of the latent variable. Through experiments on MNIST and Omniglot with a variety of architectures, we show how our framework sheds light on many recent proposed extensions to the variational autoencoder family.","['information theory', 'generative models', 'latent variable models', 'variational autoencoders']"

Moreover, we show that, under certain assumptions, these properties hold even when signals are irregularly observed. As we converge to the family of (convolutional) neural networks that satisfy these conditions, we show that we can optimize our convolution filters while constraining them so that they effectively compute a Discrete Wavelet Transform. Such a neural network can efficiently divide the time-axis of a signal into orthogonal sub-spaces of different temporal scale and localization.

320,H1uP7ebAW,Learning to diagnose from scratch by exploiting dependencies among labels,"The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures. Many tasks in radiology, for example, are largely problems of multi-label classification wherein medical images are interpreted to indicate multiple present or suspected pathologies. Clinical settings drive the necessity for high accuracy simultaneously across a multitude of pathological outcomes and greatly limit the utility of tools which consider only a subset. This issue is exacerbated by a general scarcity of training data and maximizes the need to extract clinically relevant features from available samples -- ideally without the use of pre-trained models which may carry forward undesirable biases from tangentially related tasks. We present and evaluate a partial solution to these constraints in using LSTMs to leverage interdependencies among target labels in predicting 14 pathologic patterns from chest x-rays and establish state of the art results on the largest publicly available chest x-ray dataset from the NIH without pre-training. Furthermore, we propose and discuss alternative evaluation metrics and their relevance in clinical practice.","['medical diagnosis', 'medical imaging', 'multi-label classification']"

These results are not robust and require carefully chosen functions as well as input distributions.

We show a similar separation between the expressive power of depth-2 and depth-3 sigmoidal neural networks over a large class of input distributions, as long as the weights are polynomially bounded. While doing so, we also show that depth-2 sigmoidal neural networks with small width and small weights can be well-approximated by low-degree multivariate polynomials.","['depth separation', 'neural networks', 'weights-width trade-off']"
323,HyDAQl-AW,Time Limits in Reinforcement Learning,"In reinforcement learning, it is common to let an agent interact with its environment for a fixed amount of time before resetting the environment and repeating the process in a series of episodes. The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize its performance over (i) that fixed amount of time, or (ii) an indefinite period where the time limit is only used during training. In this paper, we investigate theoretically how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases. In the first one, we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and propose to include a notion of the remaining time as part of the agent's input. In the second case, the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that such terminations should not be treated as environmental ones and propose a method, specific to value-based algorithms, that incorporates this insight by continuing to bootstrap at the end of each partial episode. To illustrate the significance of our proposals, we perform several experiments on a range of environments from simple few-state transition graphs to complex control tasks, including novel and standard benchmark domains. Our results show that the proposed methods improve the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms.","['reinforcement learning', 'Markov decision processes', 'deep learning']"

We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Arjovsky et al. 2017) which optimize such measures implicitly.  These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution.  Our experiments show that this strategy can easily be applied to different types of model architectures and solve both linear and non-linear ICA problems.

While being the core building block of deep neural networks, the way they encode information about the inputs and how such encodings emerge is still unknown. We report experiments providing strong evidence that hidden neurons behave like binary classifiers during training and testing. During training, analysis of the gradients reveals that a neuron separates two categories of inputs, which are impressively constant across training. During testing, we show that the fuzzy, binary partition described above embeds the core information used by the network for its prediction. These observations bring to light some of the core internal mechanics of deep neural networks, and have the potential to guide the next theoretical and practical developments.","['deep learning', 'experimental analysis', 'hidden neurons']"

Using these algorithms, DNN model sizes can be substantially reduced, with little to no accuracy degradation. This is achieved by either eliminating components from the model, or penalizing complexity during training. While both approaches demonstrate considerable compressions, the former often ignores the loss function during compression while the later produces unpredictable compressions. In this paper, we propose a technique that directly minimizes both the model complexity and the changes in the loss function. In this technique, we formulate compression as a constrained optimization problem, and then present a solution for it.

The rationales are learned in an unsupervised fashion, requiring no additional information beyond the end-to-end task. We formulate this problem as a reinforcement learning problem over the molecular graph, parametrized by two convolution networks corresponding to the rationale selection and prediction based on it, where the latter induces the reward function. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark toxicity datasets. We demonstrate that our model sustains high performance under the additional constraint that predictions strictly follow the rationales.

However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy.

The generator encodes the input text into a shorter word sequence, and the reconstructor recovers the generator input from the generator output.
To make the generator output human-readable, a discriminator restricts the output of the generator to resemble human-written sentences.

Multi-task learning (MTL) has been extensively explored in these studies to address challenges associated to high dimensionality and small cohort size. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the capability to capture complicated non-linear effects among the variables. In this paper, we propose the Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. We show that under mild assumptions, for each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of training data. In addition, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network quickly picks up correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using information in brain imaging.

For the first time, we establish convergence rates for signSGD on general non-convex functions under transparent conditions. We show that the rate of signSGD to reach first-order critical points matches that of SGD in terms of number of stochastic gradient calls, up to roughly a linear factor in the dimension.

In particular, in the context of deep learning, we empirically show that the spectrum of the Hessian is composed of two parts: (1) the bulk centered near zero, (2) and outliers away from the bulk. We present numerical evidence and mathematical justifications to the following conjectures laid out by Sagun et. al. (2016): Fixing data, increasing the number of parameters merely scales the bulk of the spectrum; fixing the dimension and changing the data (for instance adding more clusters or making the data less separable) only affects the outliers. We believe that our observations have striking implications for non-convex optimization in high dimensions. First, the *flatness* of such landscapes (which can be measured by the singularity of the Hessian) implies that classical notions of basins of attraction may be quite misleading. And that the discussion of wide/narrow basins may be in need of a new perspective around over-parametrization and redundancy that are able to create *large* connected components at the bottom of the landscape. Second, the dependence of a small number of large eigenvalues to the data distribution can be linked to the spectrum of the covariance matrix of gradients of model outputs. With this in mind, we may reevaluate the connections within the data-architecture-algorithm framework of a model, hoping that it would shed light on the geometry of high-dimensional and non-convex spaces in modern applications. In particular, we present a case that links the two observations: small and large batch gradient descent appear to converge to different basins of attraction but we show that they are in fact connected through their flat region and so belong to the same basin.","['Deep Learning', 'Over-parametrization', 'Hessian', 'Eigenvalues', 'Flat minima', 'Large batch Small batch']"

We propose Invariant Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks (IVE-GANs), a novel GAN framework that introduces such a mapping for individual samples from the data by utilizing features in the data which are invariant to certain transformations. Since the model maps individual samples to the latent space, it naturally encourages the generator to cover all modes.

Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a model that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan.

However, previous work in dialogue response generation has shown that these metrics do not correlate strongly with human judgment in the non task-oriented dialogue setting. Task-oriented dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in the non task-oriented setting. We also observe that these metrics correlate even better for datasets which provide multiple ground truth reference sentences.

This mixture of real and generated data is thus used to train a classifier which is afterwards tested on a given labeled test dataset. We compare this result with the score of the same classifier trained on the real training data mixed with noise. By computing the classifier's accuracy with different ratios of samples from both distributions (real and generated) we are able to estimate if the generator successfully fits and is able to generalize the distribution of the dataset.

How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research.  A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself?

We systematically characterize the fragility of the interpretations generated by several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, integrated gradient, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile.

Theoretical explanation for the cause of instability is provided in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and wasserstein distance is proposed to stablize the training. Though WGAN is indeed more stable than previous GANs, it takes much more iterations and time to train. This is because the ways to ensure Lipschitz condition in WGAN (such as weight-clipping) significantly limit the capacity of the network. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to ensure Lipschitz condition as well as maintain sufficient capacity and expressiveness of the network. To facilitate this, we develop both theoretical and practical building blocks, using which one can construct different neural networks using a large range of metrics, as well as ensure Lipschitz condition and sufficient capacity of the networks. Using the proposed building blocks, and a special choice of a metric called Dudley metric, we propose Dudley GAN that outperforms the state of the arts in both convergence and sample quality.

The importance of AL has motivated extensive research, proposing a wide variety of manually designed AL algorithms with diverse theoretical and intuitive motivations. In contrast to this body of research, we propose to treat active learning algorithm design as a meta-learning problem and learn the best criterion from data. We model an active learning algorithm as a deep neural network that inputs the base learner state and the unlabelled point set and predicts the best point to annotate next. Training this active query policy network with reinforcement learning, produces the best non-myopic policy for a given dataset. The key challenge in achieving a general solution to AL then becomes that of learner generalisation, particularly across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a multi-task dataset-embedding approach that allows dataset-agnostic active learners to be trained. Our evaluation shows that AL algorithms trained in this way can directly generalize across diverse problems.","['Active Learning', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning']"

However, for the most challenging natural image tasks the purely autoregressive model with stochastic variables still outperform the combined stochastic autoregressive models. In this paper, we present simple additions to the VAE framework that generalize to natural images by embedding spatial information in the stochastic layers. We significantly improve the state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, CIFAR10 and ImageNet when the feature map parameterization of the stochastic variables are combined with the autoregressive PixelCNN approach. Interestingly, we also observe close to state-of-the-art results without the autoregressive part. This opens the possibility for high quality image generation with only one forward-pass.

353,HyunpgbR-,Structured Exploration via Hierarchical Variational Policy Networks,"Reinforcement learning in environments with large state-action spaces is challenging, as exploration can be highly inefficient. Even if the dynamics are simple, the optimal policy can be combinatorially hard to discover. In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to structured exploration to improve the sample efficiency of on-policy exploration in large state-action spaces. The key idea is to model a stochastic policy as a hierarchical latent variable model, which can learn low-dimensional structure in the state-action space, and to define exploration by sampling from the low-dimensional latent space. This approach enables lower sample complexity, while preserving policy expressivity. In order to make learning tractable, we derive a joint learning and exploration strategy by combining hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning. The benefits of our learning approach are that 1) it is principled, 2) simple to implement, 3) easily scalable to settings with many actions and 4) easily composable with existing deep learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on learning a deep centralized multi-agent policy, as multi-agent environments naturally have an exponentially large state-action space. In this setting, the latent hierarchy implements a form of multi-agent coordination during exploration and execution (MACE). We demonstrate empirically that MACE can more efficiently learn optimal policies in challenging multi-agent games with a large number (~20) of agents, compared to conventional baselines. Moreover, we show that our hierarchical structure leads to meaningful agent coordination.","['Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Structured Variational Inference', 'Multi-agent Coordination', 'Multi-agent Learning']"

A large amount of methodologies has been developed on this topic, including ARIMA, Holt–Winters, etc. However, their performance is easily undermined by the existence of change points and anomaly points, two structures commonly observed in real data, but rarely considered in the aforementioned methods. In this paper, we propose a novel state space time series model, with the capability to capture the structure of change points and anomaly points, as well as trend and seasonality. To infer all the hidden variables, we develop a Bayesian framework, which is able to obtain distributions and forecasting intervals for time series forecasting, with provable theoretical properties. For implementation, an iterative algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Kalman filter and Kalman smoothing is proposed. In both synthetic data and real data applications, our methodology yields a better performance in time series forecasting compared with existing methods, along with more accurate change point detection and anomaly detection.","['Time Series Forecasting', 'Change Point Detection', 'Anomaly Detection', 'State Space Model', 'Bayesian']"

We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples, identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. Then with a series of carefully designed experiments,  we are able to comprehensively investigate existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1-NN) two-sample test seem to satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far these state-of-the-art GANs are from perfect.","['generative adversarial networks', 'evaluation metric']"

Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models. Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors. Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization with pruning to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques, we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with a small loss in accuracy. This technique allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the overall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up to 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to unstructured sparsity.

Specifically, this paper focuses on discovering the hidden unseen classes of the rejected examples. Clearly, without prior knowledge this is difficult. However, we do have the data from the seen training classes, which can tell us what kind of similarity/difference is expected for examples from the same class or from different classes. It is reasonable to assume that this knowledge can be transferred to the rejected examples and used to discover the hidden unseen classes in them. This paper aims to solve this problem. It first proposes a joint open classification model with a sub-model for classifying whether a pair of examples belongs to the same or different classes. This sub-model can serve as a distance function for clustering to discover the hidden classes of the rejected examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model is highly promising.

The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures. This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task. The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks.
In this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks. We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks.

Naive application of such algorithms on multiple source domain adaptation problem may lead to suboptimal solutions. We propose a new generalization bound for domain adaptation when there are multiple source domains with labeled instances and one target domain with unlabeled instances. Compared with existing bounds, the new bound does not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor the optimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theory also leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks: we show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that are invariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for the learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we call multisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes directly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the first one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The optimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be optimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs, we conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance on three real-world datasets: sentiment analysis, digit classification, and vehicle counting.

This view has been held so strongly that few researchers have analysed single units to determine if this assumption is correct. However, recent results from psychology, neuroscience and computer science have shown the occasional existence of local codes emerging in artificial and biological neural networks. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network, using generated input and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-hot output code drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer. The number of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from feed-forward PDP networks and suggests some of the conditions that may lead to interpretable localist representations in the cortex. The findings highlight how local codes should not be dismissed out of hand.","['localist', 'pdp', 'neural network', 'representation', 'psychology', 'cognition']"

In particular, the work in this domain has been focused so far only on understanding the properties of the stationary solutions that this dynamics might converge to, and of the behavior of that dynamics in this solutions’ immediate neighborhood.

To address this issue, in this work we take a first step towards a principled study of the GAN dynamics itself. To this end, we propose a model that, on one hand, exhibits several of the common problematic convergence behaviors (e.g., vanishing gradient, mode collapse, diverging or oscillatory behavior), but on the other hand, is sufficiently simple to enable rigorous convergence analysis.

This methodology enables us to exhibit an interesting phenomena: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges, while guiding the GAN training using only a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN dynamics and mode collapse. This suggests that such usage of the first order approximation of the discriminator, which is a de-facto standard in all the existing GAN dynamics, might be one of the factors that makes GAN training so challenging in practice.

To obtain the specific embedding for a particular author or venue, for example, we can then simply multiply the base embedding by the transformation matrix associated with that time or venue. The main advantages of our approach is data efficiency and interpretability of the covariate transformation matrix. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model learns substantially better embeddings conditioned on each covariate compared to the standard approach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the relevant subset of data. Furthermore, our model encourages the embeddings to be ``topic-aligned'' in the sense that the dimensions have specific independent meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to be compared by topic, enabling downstream differential analysis. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our algorithm on several datasets, and demonstrate how it can be used to address many natural questions about the effects of covariates.","['Word embedding', 'tensor decomposition']"
383,S1FFLWWCZ,"LSD-Net: Look, Step and Detect for Joint Navigation and Multi-View Recognition with Deep Reinforcement Learning","Multi-view recognition is the task of classifying an object from multi-view image sequences. Instead of using a single-view for classification, humans generally navigate around a target object to learn its multi-view representation. Motivated by this human behavior, the next best view can be learned by combining object recognition with navigation in complex environments. Since deep reinforcement learning has proven successful in navigation tasks, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework for joint multi-view recognition and navigation. Our method uses a hierarchical action space for multi-task reinforcement learning. The framework was evaluated with an environment created from the ModelNet40 dataset. Our results show improvements on object recognition and demonstrate human-like behavior on navigation.",[]
384,BJubPWZRW,Cross-View Training for Semi-Supervised Learning,"We present Cross-View Training (CVT), a simple but effective method for deep semi-supervised learning. On labeled examples, the model is trained with standard cross-entropy loss. On an unlabeled example, the model first performs inference (acting as a ""teacher"") to produce soft targets. The model then learns from these soft targets (acting as a ``""student""). We deviate from prior work by adding multiple auxiliary student prediction layers to the model. The input to each student layer is a sub-network of the full model that has a restricted view of the input  (e.g., only seeing one region of an image). The students can learn from the teacher (the full model) because the teacher sees more of each example. Concurrently, the students improve the quality of the representations used by the teacher as they learn to make predictions with limited data. When combined with Virtual Adversarial Training, CVT improves upon the current state-of-the-art on semi-supervised CIFAR-10 and semi-supervised SVHN. We also apply CVT to train models on five natural language processing tasks using hundreds of millions of sentences of unlabeled data. On all tasks CVT substantially outperforms supervised learning alone, resulting in models that improve upon or are competitive with the current state-of-the-art.

One example is the estimation of treatment effects from observational data, where a subtask is to predict the effect of a treatment on subjects that are systematically different from those who received the treatment in the data. A related kind of distributional shift appears in unsupervised domain adaptation, where we are tasked with generalizing to a distribution of inputs that is different from the one in which we observe labels. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift are often heuristic or rely on assumptions that are rarely true in practice, such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. In this work, we devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, based on integral probability metrics and sample re-weighting. We combine this idea with representation learning, generalizing and tightening existing results in this space. Finally, we propose an algorithmic framework inspired by our bound and verify is effectiveness in causal effect estimation.","['Distributional shift', 'causal effects', 'domain adaptation']"

more effectively. However standard data augmentation produces only limited
plausible alternative data. Given there is potential to generate a much broader set
of augmentations, we design and train a generative model to do data augmentation.
The model, based on image conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, takes
data from a source domain and learns to take any data item and generalise it
to generate other within-class data items. As this generative process does not
depend on the classes themselves, it can be applied to novel unseen classes of data.

Furthermore, we decompose the higher-order structure using the tensor-train (TT) decomposition to reduce the number of parameters while preserving the model performance. We theoretically establish the approximation properties of Tensor-Train RNNs for general sequence inputs, and such guarantees are not available for usual RNNs.

In this paper, we present an efficient parametrization of the transition matrix of an RNN that allows us to stabilize the gradients that arise in its training. Specifically, we parameterize the transition matrix by its singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows us to explicitly track and control its singular values. We attain efficiency by using tools that are common in numerical linear algebra, namely Householder reflectors for representing the orthogonal matrices that arise in the SVD. By explicitly controlling the singular values, our proposed svdRNN method allows us to easily solve the exploding gradient problem and we observe that it empirically solves the vanishing gradient issue to a large extent. We note that the SVD parameterization can be used for any rectangular weight matrix, hence it can be easily extended to any deep neural network, such as a multi-layer perceptron. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our parameterization does not lose any expressive power, and show how it potentially makes the optimization process easier. Our extensive  experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework converges faster, and has good generalization, especially when the depth is large.

Differently, from other approaches, the mechanism we propose just needs a single pass through the input and it can be trained end-to-end through SGD. As a consequence, the proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent, easy to implement, and faster than iterative approaches.

A typical implementation of MCTS uses cleverly designed rules, optimised to the particular characteristics of the domain. These rules control where the simulation traverses, what to evaluate in the states that are reached, and how to back-up those evaluations.

This low-rank structure makes it possible to use second-order information without needing approximations and without incurring a significantly greater computational cost than gradient descent.  To demonstrate this capability, we implement Cubic Regularization (CR) on a feedforward deep network with stochastic gradient descent and two of its variants.  There, we use CR to calculate learning rates on a per-iteration basis while training on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

This method yields a smoother contracted code space that maps similar inputs to nearby codes, and also an implicit latent variable GAN model for generation.

Through this analysis, we find that three factors – learning rate, batch size and the variance of the loss gradients – control the trade-off between the depth and width of the minima found by SGD, with wider minima favoured by a higher ratio of learning rate to batch size. In the equilibrium distribution only the ratio of learning rate to batch size appears, implying that it’s invariant under a simultaneous rescaling of each by the same amount. 
We experimentally show how learning rate and batch size affect SGD from two perspectives: the endpoint of SGD and the dynamics that lead up to it. For the endpoint, the experiments suggest the endpoint of SGD is similar under simultaneous rescaling of batch size and learning rate, and also that a higher ratio leads to flatter minima, both findings are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We note experimentally that the dynamics also seem to be similar under the same rescaling of learning rate and batch size, which we explore showing that one can exchange batch size and learning rate in a cyclical learning rate schedule. Next, we illustrate how noise affects memorization, showing that high noise levels lead to better generalization.

Recent attempts have looked into mitigating this data scarcity problem by casting their original single-task problem into a new multi-task learning (MTL) problem. The main goal of this inductive transfer mechanism is to leverage domain-specific information from related tasks, in order to improve generalization on the main task. While recent results in the deep learning (DL) community have shown the promising potential of training task-specific CNNs in a soft parameter sharing framework, integrating the recent DL advances for improving knowledge sharing is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose the Deep Collaboration Network (DCNet), a novel approach for connecting task-specific CNNs in a MTL framework. We define connectivity in terms of two distinct non-linear transformation blocks. One aggregates task-specific features into global features, while the other merges back the global features with each task-specific network. Based on the observation that task relevance depends on depth, our transformation blocks use skip connections as suggested by residual network approaches, to more easily deactivate unrelated task-dependent features. To validate our approach, we employed facial landmark detection (FLD) datasets as they are readily amenable to MTL, given the number of tasks they include. Experimental results show that we can achieve up to 24.31% relative improvement in landmark failure rate over other state-of-the-art MTL approaches.

This paper proposes the topology adaptive graph convolutional network (TAGCN), a novel graph convolutional network that generalizes CNN architectures to graph-structured data and provides a systematic way to design a set of fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs. The topologies of these filters are adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform convolution, replacing the square filter for the grid-structured data in traditional CNNs. The outputs are the weighted sum of these filters’ outputs, extraction of both vertex features and strength of correlation between vertices. It
can be used with both directed and undirected graphs. The proposed TAGCN not only inherits the properties of convolutions in CNN for grid-structured data, but it is also consistent with convolution as defined in graph signal processing.

However, there are some limitations, including noticeable performance degradation in operating regions with low computational costs, and essential performance limitations since IDP uses hand-crafted profile coefficients. In this paper, we extend IDP by proposing new training algorithms involving a single profile, which may be trainable or pre-determined, to significantly improve the overall performance, especially in operating regions with low computational costs. Specifically, we propose the Task-wise Early Stopping and Loss Aggregation (TESLA) algorithm, which is showed in our 3-layer multilayer perceptron on MNIST that outperforms the original IDP by 32\% when only 10\% of dot products terms are used and achieves 94.7\% accuracy on average.

We take an orthogonal approach and introduce MIST RNNs, a NARX RNN architecture that allows direct connections from the very distant past. We show that MIST RNNs 1) exhibit superior vanishing-gradient properties in comparison to LSTM and previously-proposed NARX RNNs; 2) are far more efficient than previously-proposed NARX RNN architectures, requiring even fewer computations than LSTM; and 3) improve performance substantially over LSTM and Clockwork RNNs on tasks requiring very long-term dependencies.","['recurrent neural networks', 'long-term dependencies', 'long short-term memory', 'LSTM']"

we propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), a fully unsupervised method, to naturally integrate dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end to end learning framework. The algorithm starts with an initial cluster estimates using an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the dimensionality reduction objective. Based on requirement and application, the temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric. Several similarity metrics are considered and compared.  To gain insight into features that the network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that generates a heat map of regions of interest in the timeseries. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated using timeseries data from diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to sensor data from spacecraft. In each case, we show that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods. This performance is attributed to fully integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion.","['Unsupervised deep learning', 'Temporal clustering', 'Event Visualization']"

We demonstrate that the hierarchical structure supports the learning of progressively more abstract representations as well as providing semantically meaningful reconstructions with different levels of fidelity. Furthermore, we show that minimizing the Jensen-Shanon divergence between the generative and inference network is enough to minimize the reconstruction error.  The resulting semantically meaningful hierarchical latent structure discovery is exemplified on the CelebA dataset.  There, we show that the features learned by our model in an unsupervised way outperform the best handcrafted features. Furthermore, the extracted features remain competitive when compared to several recent deep supervised approaches on an attribute prediction task on CelebA.

In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear. Here we show that distributions of logit differences have a universal functional form. This functional form is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; nor does it change during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.

However, tasks with sparse rewards remain challenging when the state space is large. Goal-oriented tasks are among the most typical problems in this domain, where a reward can only be received when the final goal is accomplished. In this work, we propose a potential solution to such problems with the introduction of an experience-based tendency reward mechanism, which provides the agent with additional hints based on a discriminative learning on past experiences during an automated reverse curriculum. This mechanism not only provides dense additional learning signals on what states lead to success, but also allows the agent to retain only this tendency reward instead of the whole histories of experience during multi-phase curriculum learning. We extensively study the advantages of our method on the standard sparse reward domains like Maze and Super Mario Bros and show that our method performs more efficiently and robustly than prior approaches in tasks with long time horizons and large state space. In addition, we demonstrate that using an optional keyframe scheme with very small quantity of key states, our approach can solve difficult robot manipulation challenges directly from perception and sparse rewards.","['deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'robotics', 'perception']"

(2017)) that exploit cheap approximations, e.g. training on a smaller training data or with fewer iterations, can outperform standard BO approaches that use only full-fidelity observations. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the continuous-fidelity knowledge gradient (cfKG) method, that can be used when fidelity is controlled by one or more continuous settings such as training data size and the number of training iterations. cfKG characterizes the value of the information gained by sampling a point at a given fidelity, choosing to sample at the point and fidelity with the largest value per unit cost. Furthermore, cfKG can be generalized, following Wu et al. (2017), to settings where derivatives are available in the optimization process, e.g. large-scale kernel learning, and where more than one point can be evaluated simultaneously. Numerical experiments show that cfKG outperforms state-of-art algorithms when optimizing synthetic functions, tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and in large-scale kernel learning.","['Continuous fidelity', 'Bayesian optimization', 'fast', 'knowledge gradient', 'hyperparameter optimization']"

Such advantages can potentially lead to gains in both speed and performance, but multitask networks are also difficult to train without finding the right balance between tasks. We present a novel gradient normalization (GradNorm) technique which automatically balances the multitask loss function by directly tuning the gradients to equalize task training rates. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting over single networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process which incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we hope to demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.","['Multitask learning', 'computer vision', 'multitask loss function']"

By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we
significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite
maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional

Our empirical results suggest that using the dual formulation for the restricted family of linear discriminators results in a more stable convergence to a desirable solution when compared with the performance of a primal min-max GAN-like objective and an MMD objective under the same restrictions. We test our hypothesis on the problem of aligning two synthetic point clouds on a plane and on a real-image domain adaptation problem on digits.

Several studies have demonstrated that learning extramural sub-tasks and auxiliary predictions can improve (1) single human-specified task learning, (2) transfer of learning, (3) and the agent's learned representation of the world. In all these examples, the agent was instructed what to learn about. We investigate a framework for discovery: curating a large collection of predictions, which are used to construct the agent's representation of the world. Specifically, our system maintains a large collection of predictions, continually pruning and replacing predictions. We highlight the importance of considering stability rather than convergence for such a system, and develop an adaptive, regularized algorithm towards that aim.

This is achieved by introducing a generative knowledge distillation strategy that does not store any full training examples. As an important extension of this idea, we show that lossy recollections stabilize deep networks much better than lossless sampling in resource constrained settings of lifelong learning while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. For this setting, we propose a novel dual purpose recollection buffer used to both stabilize the recollection generator itself and an accompanying reasoning model. ",[]

In this paper, we propose taking into account \emph{the inherent confidence information} produced by models when studying adversarial perturbations, where a natural measure of ``confidence'' is \|F(\bfx)\|_\infty$ (i.e. how confident $F$ is about its prediction?). Motivated by a thought experiment based on the manifold assumption, we propose a ``goodness property'' of models which states that \emph{confident regions of a good model should be well separated}. We give formalizations of this property and examine existing robust training objectives in view of them. Interestingly, we find that a recent objective by Madry et al. encourages training a model that satisfies well our formal version of the goodness property, but has a weak control of points that are wrong but with low confidence. However, if Madry et al.'s model is indeed a good solution to their objective, then good and bad points are now distinguishable and we can try to embed uncertain points back to the closest confident region to get (hopefully) correct predictions. We thus propose embedding objectives and algorithms, and perform an empirical study using this method. Our experimental results are encouraging: Madry et al.'s model wrapped with our embedding procedure achieves almost perfect success rate in defending against attacks that the base model fails on, while retaining good generalization behavior.

Current approaches to learning from demonstration and reward perform supervised learning on expert demonstration data and use reinforcement learning  to further improve performance based on reward from the environment. These tasks have divergent losses which are difficult to jointly optimize; further, such methods can be very sensitive to noisy demonstrations. We propose a unified reinforcement learning algorithm that effectively normalizes the Q-function, reducing the Q-values of actions unseen in the demonstration data.  Our Normalized Actor-Critic (NAC) method can learn from demonstration data of arbitrary quality and also leverages rewards from an interactive environment.  NAC learns an initial policy network from demonstration and refines the policy in a real environment. Crucially, both learning from demonstration and interactive refinement use exactly the same objective, unlike prior approaches that combine distinct supervised and reinforcement losses. This makes NAC robust to suboptimal demonstration data, since the method is not forced to mimic all of the examples in the dataset.

A key challenge of this formulation is that of scalability: While constraint solvers work well with few well-chosen examples, constraining the entire set of example constitutes a significant overhead in both time and memory. In this paper we address this challenge by constructing a representative subset of examples that is both small and is able to constrain the solver sufficiently. We build the subset one example at a time, using a trained discriminator to predict the probability of unchosen input-output examples conditioned on the chosen input-output examples, adding the least probable example to the subset.

NaaA enables representation trades in peer-to-peer environments, ultimately regarding unit in neural networks as agents.

One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To do this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset presented, the replicated treatment is the negative control. We find that for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal (2) less domain-specific information is present.","['Nuisance variation', 'transform learning', 'image embeddings']"

Existing models based on LSTMs require a large number of parameters to support external memory and do not generalize well for long sequence inputs. Memory networks attempt to address these limitations by storing information to an external memory module but must examine all inputs in the memory. Hence, for longer sequence inputs the intermediate memory components proportionally scale in size resulting in poor inference times and high computation costs.

In this paper, we present Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) that process input question pairs to dynamically construct a network architecture optimized for lower inference times. During inference, AMN parses input text into entities within different memory slots. However, distinct from previous approaches, AMN is a dynamic network architecture that creates variable numbers of memory banks weighted by question relevance. Thus, the decoder can select a variable number of memory banks to construct an answer using fewer banks, creating a runtime trade-off between accuracy and speed. 

AMN is enabled by first, a novel bank controller that makes discrete decisions with high accuracy and second, the capabilities of a dynamic framework (such as PyTorch) that allow for dynamic network sizing and efficient variable mini-batching. In our results, we demonstrate that our model learns to construct a varying number of memory banks based on task complexity and achieves faster inference times for standard bAbI tasks, and modified bAbI tasks.

Our proposed method starts with a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm with a heuristic reward signal to sample environment dynamics, which is then used to train the state-transition probability. Subsequently, we learn the optimal actions from expert state trajectories by supervised learning, while back-propagating the error gradients through the modeled environment dynamics. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method successfully achieves performance similar to (state, action) trajectory-based traditional imitation learning methods even in the absence of action information, with much fewer iterations compared to conventional model-free reinforcement learning methods. We also demonstrate that our method can learn to act from only video demonstrations of expert agent for simple games and can learn to achieve desired performance in less number of iterations.","['Model based reinforcement learning', 'Imitation learning', 'dynamics model']"
446,B1NOXfWR-,Neural Task Graph Execution,"In order to develop a scalable multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) agent that is able to execute many complex tasks, this paper introduces a new RL problem where the agent is required to execute a given task graph which describes a set of subtasks and dependencies among them. Unlike existing approaches which explicitly describe what the agent should do, our problem only describes properties of subtasks and relationships between them, which requires the agent to perform a complex reasoning to find the optimal subtask to execute. To solve this problem, we propose a neural task graph solver (NTS) which encodes the task graph using a recursive neural network. To overcome the difficulty of training, we propose a novel non-parametric gradient-based policy that performs back-propagation over a differentiable form of the task graph to compute the influence of each subtask on the other subtasks. Our NTS is pre-trained to approximate the proposed gradient-based policy and fine-tuned through actor-critic method. The experimental results on a 2D visual domain show that our method to pre-train from the gradient-based policy significantly improves the performance of NTS. We also demonstrate that our agent can perform a complex reasoning to find the optimal way of executing the task graph and generalize well to unseen task graphs. In addition, we compare our agent with a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method showing that our method is much more efficient than MCTS, and the performance of our agent can be further improved by combining with MCTS.

449,SJDJNzWAZ,Time-Dependent Representation for Neural Event Sequence Prediction,"Existing sequence prediction methods are mostly concerned with time-independent sequences, in which the actual time span between events is irrelevant and the distance between events is simply the difference between their order positions in the sequence. While this time-independent view of sequences is applicable for data such as natural languages, e.g., dealing with words in a sentence, it is inappropriate and inefficient for many real world events that are observed and collected at unequally spaced points of time as they naturally arise, e.g., when a person goes to a grocery store or makes a phone call. The time span between events can carry important information about the sequence dependence of human behaviors. In this work, we propose a set of methods for using time in sequence prediction. Because neural sequence models such as RNN are more amenable for handling token-like input, we propose two methods for time-dependent event representation, based on the intuition on how time is tokenized in everyday life and previous work on embedding contextualization. We also introduce two methods for using next event duration as regularization for training a sequence prediction model. We discuss these methods based on recurrent neural nets. We evaluate these methods as well as baseline models on five datasets that resemble a variety of sequence prediction tasks. The experiments revealed that the proposed methods offer accuracy gain over baseline models in a range of settings.","['Neural sequence prediction', 'Embedding', 'LSTM', 'Regularization']"

and Q is a metric that is zero if and only if all moments of the two measures
are equal, making it an appealing statistic for two-sample tests. Given i.i.d. samples
from P and Q, Gretton et al. (2012) show that we can construct an unbiased
estimator for the square of the MMD between the two distributions. If P is a
distribution of interest and Q is the distribution implied by a generative neural
network with stochastic inputs, we can use this estimator to train our neural network.
However, in practice we do not always have i.i.d. samples from our target
of interest. Data sets often exhibit biases—for example, under-representation of
certain demographics—and if we ignore this fact our machine learning algorithms
will propagate these biases. Alternatively, it may be useful to assume our data has
been gathered via a biased sample selection mechanism in order to manipulate
properties of the estimating distribution Q.
In this paper, we construct an estimator for the MMD between P and Q when we
only have access to P via some biased sample selection mechanism, and suggest
methods for estimating this sample selection mechanism when it is not already

The key challenging task in learning-based motion planning is to learn a transformation from terrain observations to a suitable navigation reward function. In order to deal with complex terrain observations and policy learning, we propose a value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the value iteration network. It relies on a soft policy model, where the policy is represented with a probability distribution over all possible actions, rather than a deterministic policy that returns only the best action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in robot motion planning scenarios. In particular, we study the application of SVIN to very challenging problems in planetary rover navigation and present early training results on data gathered by the  Curiosity rover that is currently operating on Mars.","['value iteration networks', 'robotics', 'space robotics', 'imitation learning', 'convolutional neural networks', 'path planning']"

In this paper, we propose new techniques that employ classification-based perspective to evaluate synthetic GAN distributions and their capability to accurately reflect the essential properties of the training data. These techniques require only minimal human supervision and can easily be scaled and adapted to evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art GANs on large, popular datasets.

The quality of posterior inference is largely determined by two factors: a) the ability of the variational distribution to model the true posterior and b) the capacity of the recognition network to generalize inference over all datapoints. We analyze approximate inference in variational autoencoders in terms of these factors. We find that suboptimal inference is often due to amortizing inference rather than the limited complexity of the approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation.","['Approximate Inference', 'Amortization', 'Posterior Approximations', 'Variational Autoencoder']"

However, imposing strong L1 or L2 regularization with gradient descent method easily fails, and this limits the generalization ability of the underlying neural networks. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate how and why training fails for strong regularization. Specifically, we examine how gradients change over time for different regularization strengths and provide an analysis why the gradients diminish so fast. We find that there exists a tolerance level of regularization strength, where the learning completely fails if the regularization strength goes beyond it. We propose a simple but novel method, Delayed Strong Regularization, in order to moderate the tolerance level. Experiment results show that our proposed approach indeed achieves strong regularization for both L1 and L2 regularizers and improves both accuracy and sparsity on public data sets.

This observation demonstrates that with the existing theory, we cannot adequately explain why gradient methods can find generalizable solutions for neural networks. In this work, we use a Fourier-based approach to study the generalization properties of gradient-based methods over 2-layer neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions. We prove that if the underlying distribution of data has nice spectral properties such as bandlimitedness, then the gradient descent method will converge to generalizable local minima. We also establish a Fourier-based generalization bound for bandlimited spaces, which generalizes to other activation functions. Our generalization bound motivates a grouped version of path norms for measuring the complexity of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We demonstrate numerically that regularization of this group path norm results in neural network solutions that can fit true labels without losing test accuracy while not overfitting random labels.","['Generalization', 'Neural Networks', 'Fourier Analysis']"

A coreset is a weighted subset of the original data points such that SVMs trained on the coreset are provably competitive with those trained on the original (massive) data set. We provide both lower and upper bounds on the number of samples required to obtain accurate approximations to the SVM problem as a function of the complexity of the input data.

We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes.

	In this paper, we build upon these works to explore two methods for taming the behaviors of random residual networks (with only fully connected layers and no batchnorm).
	The first method is {\it width variation (WV)}, i.e. varying the widths of layers as a function of depth.
	We show that width decay reduces gradient explosion without affecting the mean forward dynamics of the random network.
	The second method is {\it variance variation (VV)}, i.e. changing the initialization variances of weights and biases over depth.
	We show VV, used appropriately, can reduce gradient explosion of tanh and ReLU resnets from $\exp(\Theta(\sqrt L))$ and $\exp(\Theta(L))$ respectively to constant $\Theta(1)$.
	A complete phase-diagram is derived for how variance decay affects different dynamics, such as those of gradient and activation norms.
	In particular, we show the existence of many phase transitions where these dynamics switch between exponential, polynomial, logarithmic, and even constant behaviors.
	Using the obtained mean field theory, we are able to track surprisingly well how VV at initialization time affects training and test time performance on MNIST after a set number of epochs: the level sets of test/train set accuracies coincide with the level sets of the expectations of certain gradient norms or of metric expressivity (as defined in \cite{yang_meanfield_2017}), a measure of expansion in a random neural network.
	Based on insights from past works in deep mean field theory and information geometry, we also provide a new perspective on the gradient explosion/vanishing problems: they lead to ill-conditioning of the Fisher information matrix, causing optimization troubles.","['mean field', 'dynamics', 'residual network', 'variance variation', 'width variation', 'initialization']"

In this work, we propose learning to defer, a method by which a model can defer judgment to a downstream decision-maker such as a human user. We show that learning to defer generalizes the rejection learning framework in two ways: by considering the effect of other agents in the decision-making process, and by allowing for optimization of complex objectives. We propose a learning algorithm which accounts for potential biases held by decision-makerslater in a pipeline. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that learning

This makes BPTT both computationally impractical and biologically implausible. For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long sequences, and truncated backpropagation through time is used as a heuristic.  However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer term dependencies are ignored.  Addressing this issue, we propose an alternative algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights.  This allows the model to learn long term dependencies while only backtracking for a small number of time steps, not just from the recent past but also from attended relevant past states.

Moreover, GraphGAN learns a semantic mapping from the latent input space to the generated graph's properties. We discover that sampling from certain regions of the latent space leads to varying properties of the output graphs, with smooth transitions between them. Strong generalization properties of GraphGAN are highlighted by its competitive performance in link prediction as well as promising results on node classification, even though not specifically trained for these tasks.","['GAN', 'graphs', 'random walks', 'implicit generative models']"
479,rk9kKMZ0-,LEAP: Learning Embeddings for Adaptive Pace,"Determining the optimal order in which data examples are presented to Deep Neural Networks during training is a non-trivial problem. However, choosing a non-trivial scheduling method may drastically improve convergence. In this paper, we propose a Self-Paced Learning (SPL)-fused Deep Metric Learning (DML) framework, which we call Learning Embeddings for Adaptive Pace (LEAP). Our method parameterizes mini-batches dynamically based on the \textit{easiness} and \textit{true diverseness} of the sample within a salient feature representation space. In LEAP, we train an \textit{embedding} Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn an expressive representation space by adaptive density discrimination using the Magnet Loss. The \textit{student} CNN classifier dynamically selects samples to form a mini-batch based on the \textit{easiness} from cross-entropy losses and \textit{true diverseness} of examples from the representation space sculpted by the \textit{embedding} CNN. We evaluate LEAP using deep CNN architectures for the task of supervised image classification on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. We show that the LEAP framework converges faster with respect to the number of mini-batch updates required to achieve a comparable or better test performance on each of the datasets.","['deep metric learning', 'self-paced learning', 'representation learning', 'cnn']"

With more than hundreds of Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS prediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two major biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding patterns on genomes known as “motifs” and (2) interactions among TFs known as co-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Prototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN model automatically extracts prototypes (“motif”-like features) for each TF through a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching models, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers TF-TF interactions for large scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.","['bioinformatics', 'multi-label classification', 'matching networks', 'prototypes', 'memory networks', 'attention']"

These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.","['Graph Neural Network', 'Attention', 'Semi-supervised Learning']"

To promote these benefits, it is desired to effectively expand the scale of high-quality yet novel relational medical entity pairs that embody rich medical knowledge in a structured form. To fulfill this goal, we introduce a generative model called Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE), which can discover meaningful and novel relational medical entity pairs without the requirement of additional external knowledge. Rather than discriminatively identifying the relationship between two given medical entities in a free-text corpus, we directly model and understand medical relationships from diversely expressed medical entity pairs. The proposed model introduces the generative modeling capacity of variational autoencoder to entity pairs, and has the ability to discover new relational medical entity pairs solely based on the existing entity pairs. Beside entity pairs, relationship-enhanced entity representations are obtained as another appealing benefit of the proposed method. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating relational medical entity pairs that are meaningful and novel.","['Knowledge Discovery', 'Generative Modeling', 'Medical', 'Entity Pair']"

First, we propose a natural way of specifying the loss function for GANs by drawing a connection with supervised learning. Second, we shed light on the statistical performance of GANs through the analysis of a simple LQG setting: the generator is linear, the loss function is quadratic and the data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. We show that  in this setting: 1) the optimal GAN solution converges to population Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the number of training samples increases; 2) the number of samples required scales exponentially with the dimension of the data; 3) the number of samples scales almost linearly if the discriminator is constrained to be quadratic.

Yet, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed inputs that cause networks to misbehave in arbitrarily chosen ways. When generated with standard methods, these examples do not consistently fool a classifier in the physical world due to a combination of viewpoint shifts, camera noise, and other natural transformations. Adversarial examples generated using standard techniques require complete control over direct input to the classifier, which is impossible in many real-world systems.

We introduce the first method for constructing real-world 3D objects that consistently fool a neural network across a wide distribution of angles and viewpoints. We present a general-purpose algorithm for generating adversarial examples that are robust across any chosen distribution of transformations. We demonstrate its application in two dimensions, producing adversarial images that are robust to noise, distortion, and affine transformation. Finally, we apply the algorithm to produce arbitrary physical 3D-printed adversarial objects, demonstrating that our approach works end-to-end in the real world. Our results show that adversarial examples are a practical concern for real-world systems.

On one hand, traditional word embeddings are trained on a large scale corpus for general-purpose tasks, which are often sub-optimal for many domain-specific tasks. On the other hand, many domain-specific tasks do not have a large enough domain corpus to obtain high-quality embeddings. We observe that domains are not isolated and a small domain corpus can leverage the learned knowledge from many past domains to augment that corpus in order to generate high-quality embeddings. In this paper, we formulate the learning of word embeddings as a lifelong learning process. Given knowledge learned from many previous domains and a small new domain corpus, the proposed method can effectively generate new domain embeddings by leveraging a simple but effective algorithm and a meta-learner, where the meta-learner is able to provide word context similarity information at the domain-level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively learn new domain embeddings from a small corpus and past domain knowledges\footnote{We will release the code after final revisions.}.

In our analysis, we find out although currently second-order methods are too slow to be applied in practice, it can reduce training loss in fewer number of iterations compared with SGD. In addition, we have the following interesting findings: (1) When using a large batch size, inexact-Newton methods will converge much faster than SGD. Therefore inexact-Newton method could be a better choice in distributed training of deep networks. (2) Quasi-newton methods are competitive with SGD even when using ReLu activation function (which has no curvature) on residual networks. However, current methods are too sensitive to parameters and not easy to tune for different settings. Therefore, quasi-newton methods with more self-adjusting mechanisms might be more useful than SGD in training deeper networks.

However, most existing methods are post-processing approaches in that they take a learned neural network as input and output a compressed network by either forcing several parameters to take the same value (parameter tying via quantization) or pruning irrelevant edges (pruning) or both. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that jointly learns and compresses a neural network. The key idea in our approach is to change the optimization criteria by adding $k$ independent Gaussian priors over the parameters and a sparsity penalty. We show that our approach is easy to implement using existing neural network libraries, generalizes L1 and L2 regularization and elegantly enforces parameter tying as well as pruning constraints.

We model patient continuous-valued physiological time series using multi-output Gaussian processes, a probabilistic model that easily handles missing values and irregularly spaced observation times while maintaining estimates of uncertainty. The Gaussian process is directly tied to a deep recurrent Q-network that learns clinically interpretable treatment policies, and both models are learned together end-to-end.  We evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset of septic spanning 15 months from our university health system, and find that our learned policy could reduce patient mortality by as much as 8.2\% from an overall baseline mortality rate of 13.3\%.  Our algorithm could be used to make treatment recommendations to physicians as part of a decision support tool, and the framework readily applies to other reinforcement learning problems that rely on sparsely sampled and frequently missing multivariate time series data.

Here, we propose to measure networks in an $L^2$ Hilbert space, and test a learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space each update.  This approach is inspired by the slow movement of gradient descent through parameter space as well as by the natural gradient, which can be derived from a regularization term upon functional change. The resulting learning rule, which we call Hilbert-constrained gradient descent (HCGD), is thus closely related to the natural gradient but regularizes a different and more calculable metric over the space of functions. Experiments show that the HCGD is efficient and leads to considerably better generalization. ","['natural gradient', 'generalization', 'optimization', 'function space', 'Hilbert']"

In this paper, we present an approach of fast reading for text classification. Inspired by several well-known human reading techniques, our approach implements an intelligent recurrent agent which evaluates the importance of the current snippet in order to decide whether to make a prediction, or to skip some texts, or to re-read part of the sentence. Our agent uses an RNN module to encode information from the past and the current tokens, and applies a policy module to form decisions.

There have been several other works that suggest faster epoch wise convergence by using weighted non-uniform sampling for better gradient estimates. Unfortunately, the per-iteration cost of maintaining this adaptive distribution for gradient estimation is more than calculating the full gradient. As a result, the false impression of faster convergence in iterations leads to slower convergence in time, which we call a chicken-and-egg loop. In this paper, we break this barrier by providing the first demonstration of a sampling scheme, which leads to superior gradient estimation, while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to that of the uniform sampling. Such an algorithm is possible due to the sampling view of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which came to light recently.

Specifically, we show that an RCN trained to identify relationships between image-pairs drawn from a subset of digits from the MNIST database or the depth maps of subset of visual scenes from a moving camera generalizes the learned transformations to images of digits unseen during training or depth maps of different visual scenes. We infer, using Principal Component Analysis, that the high dimensional reservoir states generated from an input image pair with a specific transformation converge over time to a unique relationship. Thus, as opposed to training the entire high dimensional reservoir state, the reservoir only needs to train on these unique relationships, allowing the reservoir to perform well with very few training examples. Thus, generalization of learning to unseen images is interpretable in terms of clustering of the reservoir state onto the attractor corresponding to the transformation in reservoir space. We find that RCNs can identify and generalize linear and non-linear transformations, and combinations of transformations, naturally and be a robust and effective image classifier. Additionally, RCNs perform significantly better than state of the art neural network classification techniques such as deep Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) in generalization tasks both on the MNIST dataset and more complex depth maps of visual scenes from a moving camera.

In the first stage, we run SG-MCMC with group sparse priors to draw an ensemble of samples from the posterior distribution of network parameters. In the second stage, we apply weight-pruning to each sampled network and then perform retraining over the remained connections.
In this way of learning SSEs with SG-MCMC and pruning, we not only achieve high prediction accuracy since SG-MCMC enhances exploration of the model-parameter space, but also reduce memory and computation cost significantly in both training and testing of NN ensembles.
This is thoroughly evaluated in the experiments of learning SSE ensembles of both FNNs and LSTMs.
For example, in LSTM based language modeling (LM), we obtain 21\% relative reduction in LM perplexity by learning a SSE of 4 large LSTM models, which has only 30\% of model parameters and 70\% of computations in total, as compared to the baseline large LSTM LM.
To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first methodology and empirical study of integrating SG-MCMC, group sparse prior and network pruning together for learning NN ensembles.","['ensemble learning', 'SG-MCMC', 'group sparse prior', 'network pruning']"

We also formulate a zero-sum dynamic game for designing robust deep reinforcement learning policies. Our approach mitigates the brittleness of policies when agents are trained in a simulated environment and are later exposed to the real world where it is hazardous to employ RL policies. This framework for training deep RL policies involve a zero-sum  dynamic game against an adversarial agent, where the goal is to drive the system dynamics to a saddle region. Using a variant of the guided policy search algorithm, our agent learns to adopt robust policies that require less samples for learning the dynamics and performs better than the GPS algorithm. Without loss of generality, we demonstrate that deep RL policies trained in this fashion will be maximally robust to a ``worst"" possible adversarial disturbances.","['game-theory', 'reinforcement-learning', 'guided-policy-search', 'dynamic-programming']"

It is known that an attacker can generate strong adversarial examples if she knows the classifier parameters. Conversely, a defender can robustify the classifier by retraining if she has the adversarial examples. 
The cat-and-mouse game nature of attacks and defenses raises the question of the presence of equilibria in the dynamics.
In this paper, we present a neural-network based attack class to approximate a larger but intractable class of attacks, and 
formulate the attacker-defender interaction as a zero-sum leader-follower game. We present sensitivity-penalized optimization algorithms to find minimax solutions, which are the best worst-case defenses against whitebox attacks.

To generalize to unseen environments, an agent needs to be robust to low-level variations (e.g. color, texture, object changes), and also high-level variations (e.g. layout changes of the environment). To improve overall generalization, all types of variations in the environment have to be taken under consideration via different level of data augmentation steps. To this end, we propose House3D, a rich, extensible and efficient environment that contains 45,622 human-designed 3D scenes of visually realistic houses, ranging from single-room studios to multi-storied houses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and scene layouts, based on the SUNCG dataset (Song et al., 2017). The diversity in House3D opens the door towards scene-level augmentation, while the label-rich nature of House3D enables us to inject pixel- & task-level augmentations such as domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) and multi-task training. Using a subset of houses in House3D, we show that reinforcement learning agents trained with an enhancement of different levels of augmentations perform much better in unseen environments than our baselines with raw RGB input by over 8% in terms of navigation success rate.

We focus specifically on two aspects of video prediction: accurately modeling object motion, and producing naturalistic image predictions. Our model is based on a flow-based generator network with a discriminator used to improve prediction quality. The implicit flow in the generator can be examined to determine its accuracy, and the predicted images can be evaluated for image quality. We argue that these two metrics are critical for understanding whether the model has effectively learned object motion, and propose a novel evaluation benchmark based on ground truth object flow.

The current state of the art model for this task first computes a query-aware representation for the passage and then \textit{selects} the option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of \textit{elimination} and \textit{selection}. Specifically, a human would first try to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the document again in the light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose \textit{ElimiNet}, a neural network based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the \{\textit{document, question}\} pair and if so it tries to make the document representation orthogonal to this eliminatedd option (akin to ignoring portions of the document corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the document representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently released large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current state of the art model on 7 out of the 13 question types in this dataset. Further we show that taking an ensemble of our \textit{elimination-selection} based method with a \textit{selection} based method gives us an improvement of 7\% (relative) over the best reported performance on this dataset.

RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from ‘serialised’ MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data, and demonstrate results from differentially private training of the RCGAN.","['GAN', 'medical', 'records', 'time', 'series', 'generation', 'privacy']"

We smooth the objective of neural networks w.r.t small adversarial perturbations of the inputs. Different from previous works, we assume the adversarial perturbations are caused by the movement field. When the magnitude of movement field approaches 0, we call it virtual movement field. By introducing the movement field, we cast the problem of finding adversarial perturbations into the problem of finding adversarial movement field. By adding proper geometrical constraints to the movement field, such smoothness can be approximated in closed-form by solving a min-max problem and its geometric meaning is clear. We define the approximated smoothness as the regularization term.  We derive three regularization terms as running examples which measure the smoothness w.r.t shift, rotation and scale respectively by adding different constraints.

Yet language generated by RNNs often shows several degenerate characteristics that are uncommon in human language; while fluent, RNN language production can be overly generic, repetitive, and even self-contradictory.  We postulate that the objective function optimized by RNN language models, which amounts to the overall perplexity of a text, is not expressive enough to capture the abstract qualities of good generation such as Grice’s Maxims. In this paper, we introduce a general learning framework that can construct a decoding objective better suited for generation.

datasets are difficult to collect in problems that involve processing of sensitive information.
Collaborative learning techniques provide a privacy-preserving solution in such cases, by enabling
training over a number of private datasets that are not shared by their owners.
Existing collaborative learning
techniques, combined with differential privacy, are shown to be resilient against a passive
adversary which tries to infer the training data only from the model parameters. However, recently, it has
been shown that the existing collaborative learning techniques are vulnerable to an active adversary that runs a GAN
attack during the learning phase. In this work, we propose a novel key-based collaborative learning technique that is
resilient against such GAN attacks. For this purpose, we present a collaborative learning formulation in which class scores 
are protected by class-specific keys, and therefore, prevents a GAN attack. We also show that
very high dimensional class-specific keys can be utilized to improve robustness against attacks, without increasing the model complexity. 
Our experimental results on two popular datasets, MNIST and AT&T Olivetti Faces, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique
against the GAN attack. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first collaborative learning

We desire a method for learning a representation of the manifolds induced by identity-preserving transformations that can be used to increase robustness, reduce the training burden, and encourage interpretability in machine learning tasks. In particular, what is needed is a representation of the transformation manifold that can robustly capture the shape of the manifold from the input data, generate new points on the manifold, and extend transformations outside of the training domain without significantly increasing the error. Previous work has proposed algorithms to efficiently learn analytic operators (called transport operators) that define the process of transporting one data point on a manifold to another.  The main contribution of this paper is to define two transfer learning methods that use this generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data. The first method uses this representation in a novel randomized approach to transfer learning that employs the learned generative model to map out unseen regions of the data space. These results are shown through demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification. The second method use of transport operators for injecting specific transformations into new data examples which allows for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation.  These results are shown on stylized constructions using the classic swiss roll data structure and in demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification.

When its activation function is linear and the encoding dimension (width of hidden layer) is smaller than the input dimension, it is well known that auto-encoder is optimized to learn the principal components of the data distribution (Oja1982).
However, when the activation is nonlinear and when the width is larger than the input dimension (overcomplete), auto-encoder behaves differently from PCA, and in fact is known to perform well empirically for sparse coding problems. 

We provide a theoretical explanation for this empirically observed phenomenon, when rectified-linear unit (ReLu) is adopted as the activation function and the hidden-layer width is set to be large.
In this case, we show that, with significant probability, initializing the weight matrix of an auto-encoder by sampling from a spherical Gaussian distribution followed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training converges towards the ground-truth representation for a class of sparse dictionary learning models.
In addition, we can show that, conditioning on convergence, the expected convergence rate is O(1/t), where t is the number of updates.

We then provide the first empirical characterization of the topological capacity of neural networks.

When sentence structure is used for comparison, it is obtained during a non-differentiable pre-processing step, leading to propagation of errors. We introduce a model of structured alignments between sentences, showing how to compare two sentences by matching their latent structures. Using a structured attention mechanism, our model matches possible spans in the first sentence to possible spans in the second sentence, simultaneously discovering the tree structure of each sentence and performing a comparison, in a model that is fully differentiable and is trained only on the comparison objective. We evaluate this model on two sentence comparison tasks: the Stanford natural language inference dataset and the TREC-QA dataset.

To combat the complexity of design choices in multi-branch architectures, prior work has adopted simple strategies, such as a fixed branching factor, the same input being fed to all parallel branches, and an additive combination of the outputs produced by all branches at aggregation points. 

In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between branches in the network. Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss function defined with respect to the end task. We demonstrate our approach on the problem of multi-class image classification using four different datasets where it yields consistently higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art ``ResNeXt'' multi-branch network given the same learning capacity.","['connectivity learning', 'multi-branch networks', 'image categorization']"
543,HJnQJXbC-,AMPNet: Asynchronous Model-Parallel Training for Dynamic Neural Networks,"
New types of compute hardware in development and entering the market hold the promise of revolutionizing deep learning in a manner as profound as GPUs. However, existing software frameworks and training algorithms for deep learning have yet to evolve to fully leverage the capability of the new wave of silicon. In particular, models that exploit structured input via complex and instance-dependent control flow are difficult to accelerate using existing algorithms and hardware that typically rely on minibatching. We present an asynchronous model-parallel (AMP) training algorithm that is specifically motivated by training on networks of interconnected devices. Through an implementation on multi-core CPUs, we show that AMP training converges to the same accuracy as conventional synchronous training algorithms in a similar number of epochs, but utilizes the available hardware more efficiently, even for small minibatch sizes, resulting in shorter overall training times. Our framework opens the door for scaling up a new class of deep learning models that cannot be efficiently trained today.","['asynchronous', 'neural network', 'deep learning', 'graph', 'tree', 'rnn']"

The technique essentially contains two consecutive steps in each iteration: 1) computing and normalizing each block (layer) of the mini-batch stochastic gradient; 2) selecting appropriate step size to update the decision variable (parameter) towards the negative of the block-normalized gradient. We conduct extensive empirical studies on various non-convex neural network optimization problems, including multilayer perceptron, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The results indicate the block-normalized gradient can help accelerate the training of neural networks.  In particular,
we observe that the normalized gradient methods having constant step size with occasionally decay, such as SGD with momentum, have better performance in the deep convolution neural networks, while those with adaptive step sizes, such as Adam, perform better in recurrent neural networks. Besides, we also observe this line of methods can lead to solutions with better generalization properties, which is confirmed by the performance improvement over strong baselines. ",[]

After a trained model is obtained, one can sample the Generator in various forms for exploration and understanding, such as interpolating between two samples, sampling in the vicinity of a sample or exploring differences between a pair of samples applied to a third sample.
In this paper, we show that the latent space operations used in the literature so far induce a distribution mismatch between the resulting outputs and the prior distribution the model was trained on. To address this, we propose to use distribution matching transport maps to ensure that such  latent space operations preserve the prior distribution, while minimally modifying the original operation.

We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting questions, which is inspired by formal approaches to semantics. Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a knowledge graph, together with a vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning. Learned composition modules recursively combine constituents, culminating in a grounding for the complete sentence which is an answer to the question. For example, to interpret ‘not green’, the model will represent ‘green’ as a set of entities, ‘not’ as a trainable ungrounded vector, and then use this vector to parametrize a composition function to perform a complement operation. For each sentence, we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient descent. We show the model can learn to represent a variety of challenging semantic operators, such as quantifiers, negation, disjunctions and composed relations on a synthetic question answering task. The model also generalizes well to longer sentences than seen in its training data, in contrast to LSTM and RelNet baselines.

In the training of Bi-LSTMs, the forward and backward paths are learned independently. We propose a variant of the Bi-LSTM architecture, which we call Variational Bi-LSTM, that creates a dependence between the two paths (during training, but which may be omitted during inference).

We propose a simple procedure for assessing generative adversarial network performance based on a principled consideration of what the actual goal of generalisation is. Our approach involves using a test set to estimate the Wasserstein distance between the generative distribution produced by our procedure, and the underlying data distribution. We use this procedure to assess the performance of several modern generative adversarial network architectures. We find that this procedure is sensitive to the choice of ground metric on the underlying data space, and suggest a choice of ground metric that substantially improves performance.  We finally suggest that attending to the ground metric used in Wasserstein generative adversarial network training may be fruitful, and outline a concrete pathway towards doing so.","['generative adversarial networks', 'Wasserstein', 'GAN', 'generalization', 'theory']"

Compared to original GAN model, this model has multiple generators and gives control over what its generators should generate. Unlike previous multi-generator models use a subsequent generation process, that one layer is generated given the previous layer, our model uses a process of generating different part of the images together. This way the model contains fewer parameters and the generation speed is faster. Speciﬁcally, the model leverages the label information to separate the object from the image correctly. Since the model conditional on the label information does not restrict to generate other parts of an image, we proposed a cost function that encourages the model to generate only the succinct part of an image in terms of label discrimination. We also found an exclusive prior on the mask of the model help separate the object. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show 3C-GAN can generate different objects with different generators simultaneously, according to the labels given to each generator.",[]

However, it is known that they have their own shortcomings; ML presents training/testing discrepancy, whereas RL suffers from sample inefficiency. We point out that it is difficult to resolve all of the shortcomings simultaneously because of a tradeoff between ML and RL. In order to counteract these problems, we propose an objective function for sequence generation using α-divergence, which leads to an ML-RL integrated method that exploits better parts of ML and RL. We demonstrate that the proposed objective function generalizes ML and RL objective functions because it includes both as its special cases (ML corresponds to α → 0 and RL to α → 1). We provide a proposition stating that the difference between the RL objective function and the proposed one monotonically decreases with increasing α. Experimental results on machine translation tasks show that minimizing the proposed objective function achieves better sequence generation performance than ML-based methods.","['neural network', 'reinforcement learning', 'natural language processing', 'machine translation', 'alpha-divergence']"
555,r1ayG7WRZ,Don't encrypt the data; just approximate the model \ Towards Secure Transaction and Fair Pricing of Training Data,"As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, deployed systems need to be as accu- rate as they can. As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don’t have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn’t, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model. Future work will be focused on establishing a system with stronger transactional security against adversarial attacks that will reveal details about the model or the data to the other party.","['Applications', 'Security in Machine Learning', 'Fairness and Security', 'Model Compression']"
556,rJIgf7bAZ,An inference-based policy gradient method for learning options,"In the pursuit of increasingly intelligent learning systems, abstraction plays a vital role in enabling sophisticated decisions to be made in complex environments. The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of decisions.  However most models require that options be given a priori, presumably specified by hand, which is neither efficient, nor scalable. Indeed, it is preferable to learn options directly from interaction with the environment. Despite several efforts, this remains a difficult problem: many approaches require access to a model of the environmental dynamics, and inferred options are often not interpretable, which limits our ability to explain the system behavior for verification or debugging purposes.  In this work we develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options.  This algorithm uses inference methods to simultaneously improve all of the options available to an agent, and thus can be employed in an off-policy manner, without observing option labels. Experimental results show that the options learned can be interpreted. Further, we find that the method presented here is more sample efficient than existing methods, leading to faster and more stable learning of policies with options.","['reinforcement learning', 'hierarchy', 'options', 'inference']"

Consider a visual arithmetic task, where the goal is to carry out simple arithmetical algorithms on digits presented under natural conditions (e.g. hand-written, placed randomly). We propose a two-tiered architecture for tackling this kind of problem. The lower tier consists of a heterogeneous collection of information processing modules, which can include pre-trained deep neural networks for locating and extracting characters from the image, as well as modules performing symbolic transformations on the representations extracted by perception. The higher tier consists of a controller, trained using reinforcement learning, which coordinates the modules in order to solve the high-level task. For instance, the controller may learn in what contexts to execute the perceptual networks and what symbolic transformations to apply to their outputs. The resulting model is able to solve a variety of tasks in the visual arithmetic domain,and has several advantages over standard, architecturally homogeneous feedforward networks including improved sample efficiency.","['reinforcement learning', 'pretrained', 'deep learning', 'perception', 'algorithmic']"

To validate our hypothesis, we focus on the ‘image’ side of image captioning, and vary the input image representation but keep the RNN text generation model of a CNN-RNN constant. We propose a sparse bag-of-objects vector as an interpretable representation to investigate our distributional similarity hypothesis. We found that image captioning models (i) are capable of separating structure from noisy input representations; (ii) experience virtually no significant performance loss when a high dimensional representation is compressed to a lower dimensional space; (iii) cluster images with similar visual and linguistic information together; (iv) are heavily reliant on test sets with a similar distribution as the training set; (v) repeatedly generate the same captions by matching images and ‘retrieving’ a caption in the joint visual-textual space. Our experiments all point to one fact: that our distributional similarity hypothesis holds. We conclude that, regardless of the image representation, image captioning systems seem to match images and generate captions in a learned joint image-text semantic subspace.

This constraint can be applied to the gradients of any TD objective, and can be easily applied to nonlinear function approximation. We validate this update by applying our technique to deep Q-learning, and training without a target network. We also show that adding this constraint on Baird's counterexample keeps Q-learning from diverging.","['Reinforcement Learning', 'TD Learning', 'DQN']"

Alternatively, WSNet proposes learning model parameters by sampling from a compact set of learnable parameters, which naturally enforces {parameter sharing} throughout the learning process. We demonstrate that such a novel weight sampling approach (and induced WSNet) promotes both weights and computation sharing favorably. By employing this method, we can more efficiently learn much smaller networks with competitive performance compared to baseline networks with equal numbers of convolution filters. Specifically, we consider learning compact and efficient 1D convolutional neural networks for audio classification. Extensive experiments on multiple audio classification datasets verify the effectiveness of WSNet.

However the state-of-the-art models utilize fully entangled latent representations where small changes to a single neuron can effect every output pixel in relatively arbitrary ways, and different neurons have possibly arbitrary relationships with each other. This limits the ability of such models to generalize to new combinations or orientations of objects as well as their ability to connect with more structured representations such as natural language, without explicit strong supervision. In this work explore the synergistic effect of using partial natural language scene descriptions to help disentangle the latent entities visible an image. We present a novel neural network architecture called Generative Entity Networks, which jointly generates both the natural language descriptions and the images from a set of latent entities. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder framework and makes use of visual attention to identify and characterise the visual attributes of each entity.

Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations.  Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment.

However, adding the reward optimization on the fly usually provides little guidance for language construction and the conversation model soon becomes decoupled from the language model.

Although building models and inference algorithms for structured data has been an important task in the fields of machine learning and statistics, research on \enquote{set-like} data still remains less explored. Relationships between pairs of elements can be modeled as edges in a graph. However, modeling relationships that involve all members of a set, a hyperedge is a more natural representation for the set. In this work, we focus on the problem of embedding hyperedges in a hypergraph (a network of overlapping sets) to a low dimensional vector space. We propose a probabilistic deep-learning based method as well as a tensor-based algebraic model, both of which capture the hypergraph structure in a principled manner without loosing set-level information. Our central focus is to highlight the connection between hypergraphs (topology), tensors (algebra) and probabilistic models. We present a number of interesting baselines, some of which adapt existing node-level embedding models to the hyperedge-level, as well as sequence based language techniques which are adapted for set structured hypergraph topology. The performance is evaluated with a network of social groups and a network of word phrases. Our experiments show that accuracy wise our methods perform similar to those of baselines which are not designed for hypergraphs. Moreover, our tensor based method is quiet efficient as compared to deep-learning based auto-encoder method. We therefore, argue that we have proposed more general methods which are suited for hypergraphs (and therefore also for graphs) while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.

575,HkPCrEZ0Z,Combining Model-based and Model-free RL via Multi-step Control Variates,"Model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms are able to successfully solve a wide range of continuous control tasks, but typically require many on-policy samples to achieve good performance. Model-based RL algorithms are sample-efficient on the other hand, while learning accurate global models of complex dynamic environments has turned out to be tricky in practice, which leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned policies. In this work, we combine the sample-efficiency of model-based algorithms and the accuracy of model-free algorithms. We leverage multi-step neural network based predictive models by embedding real trajectories into imaginary rollouts of the model, and use the imaginary cumulative rewards as control variates for model-free algorithms. In this way, we achieved the strengths of both sides and derived an estimator which is not only sample-efficient, but also unbiased and of very low variance. We present our evaluation on the MuJoCo and OpenAI Gym benchmarks. ",[]
576,Syt0r4bRZ,Tree2Tree Learning with Memory Unit,"Traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) or convolutional neural net- work (CNN) based sequence-to-sequence model can not handle tree structural data well. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a tree-to-tree model with specially designed encoder unit and decoder unit, which recursively encodes tree inputs into highly folded tree embeddings and decodes the embeddings into tree outputs. Our model could represent the complex information of a tree while also restore a tree from embeddings.
We evaluate our model in random tree recovery task and neural machine translation task. Experiments show that our model outperforms the baseline model.",[]
577,S1sRrN-CW,Revisiting Knowledge Base Embedding as Tensor Decomposition,"We study the problem of knowledge base (KB) embedding, which is usually addressed through two frameworks---neural KB embedding and tensor decomposition. In this work, we theoretically analyze the neural embedding framework and subsequently connect it with tensor based embedding. Specifically, we show that in neural KB embedding the two commonly adopted optimization solutions---margin-based and negative sampling losses---are closely related to each other. We also reach the closed-form tensor that is implicitly approximated by popular neural KB approaches, revealing the underlying connection between neural and tensor based KB embedding models. Grounded in the theoretical results, we further present a tensor decomposition based framework KBTD to directly approximate the derived closed form tensor. Under this framework, the neural KB embedding models, such as NTN, TransE, Bilinear, and DISTMULT, are unified into a general tensor optimization architecture. Finally, we conduct experiments on the link prediction task in WordNet and Freebase, empirically demonstrating the effectiveness of the KBTD framework.
